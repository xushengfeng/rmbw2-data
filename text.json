And his dad, Albert, took the money my dad earned and used it to pay familyexpenses.\nI didn't really understand his world either: He was a livestock trucker, and I thought that I would surpass (超过) anything he had accomplished by the time I walked across the stage at high school graduation.\nSummers in the mid-70s were spent at home shooting baskets, hitting a baseball, or throwing a football, preparing for my future as a quarterback on a football team. In poor weather, I read about sports or practiced my trombone (长号).\nThe summer before my eighth grade I was one of a group of boys that a neighboring farmer hired to work in his field. He explained our basic task, the tractor fired up and we were off, riding down the field looking for weeds to spray with chemicals. After a short way, the farmer stopped and pointed at a weed which we missed. Then we began again. This happened over and over, but we soon learned to identify different grasses like cockleburs, lamb's-quarters, foxtails, and the king of weeds, the pretty purple thistle. It was tiring work, but I looked forward to the pay, even though I wasn't sure how much it would amount to.\nAt home, my dad said, \"A job's a big step to growing up. I'm glad you will be contributing to the household.\" My dad's words made me realize that my earnings might not be mine to do with as I wished.\nMy labors lasted about two weeks, and the farmer said there might be more work, but I wasn't interested. I decided it was not fairthat I had to contribute my money.\nThe pay arrived at last. Although the job was very tiring, I was very happy in my heart for I got something from my work. The toil of labor was forgotten for the time being. I thought I should have my own money and planned how to spend it. “How much money have you earned?” Dad asked. I was surprised, reluctant to say my income. The next morning, my dad’s livestock truck started running. I saw my father’s hard-working figure and thought of his words “A job’s a big step to growing up”.\nI understood immediately what my parents wereworried about. They were worried that I was too selfish to give. I realized that my labor was very hard, but my growth and our whole family had been depending on the hard work of my parents! Dad never complained about unfairness! He even seemed to think that was fair. I thought, “I’ve only worked for two weeks, but how many years my father has worked!” In the evening, Dad came back. I proudly took out my own money and handed it to Dad.",

One of his friends had stopped to make a bicycle repair, but they had encouraged Mac to carry on, and they would catch up with him soon. As Mac pedaled(骑行) along alone, he thought fondly of his wife and two young daughters at home. He hoped to show them this beautiful place someday.\nThen Mac heard quick and loud breathing behind him. \"Man, that’s a big dog!\" he thought. But when he looked to the side, he saw instantly that it wasn’t a dog at all, but awolf, quickly catching up with him.\nMac’s heartjumped. He found out his can of bear spray. With one hand on the bars, he fired the spray at the wolf. A bright red cloud enveloped the animal, and to Mac’s relief, it fell back, shaking its head. But a minute later, it was by his side again. Then it attacked the back of Mac’s bike, tearing open his tent bag. He fired at the wolf a second time, and again, it fell back only to quickly restart the chase(追赶).\nMac was pedaling hard now. He waved and yelled at passingcars but was careful not to slow down. He saw a steep uphill climb before him. He knew that once he hit the hill, he’d be easily caught up and the wolf’s teeth would be tearing into his flesh.\nAt this moment,Paul and Becky were driving their car on their way to Alaska. They didn’t think much of it when they saw two cyclists repairing their bike on the side of the road. A bit later, they spotted what they, too, assumed was a dog running alongside a man on a bike. As they got closer, they realized that the dog was a wolf. Mac heard a large vehicle behind him. He pulled in front of it as the wolf was catching up fast, just a dozen yards away now.\nThe car abruptly stopped in front of him. Paul and Becky got out of the car immediately to give help. But with the bare hands, they didn’t dare to fight with the wolf. However, they still approached to the wolf bravely. At the same time, the wolf also noticed them and turned its head back, shouting loudly at Paul and Becky. Mac then jumped off the bicycle and was ready to fight against the wolf. That reached deadlock.\nA few minutes later, the other two cyclists arrived. They found the dangerous situation, where three men circled the wolf. Mac’s friends also jumped off their bicycles and joined the fight with the wolf. More and more cars stopped. Some drivers took out the sticks from the cars, and some took out the knives, even the guns towards the wolf.  Just at that time, the wolf might feel the threats from the people, starting to withdraw. Soon, it ran away off the road and disappeared in the distance.",

He decided to take me on a trip to the Wild West.\nWe took a plane to Albuquerque, a big city in the state of New Mexico. We reached Albuquerque in the late afternoon. Uncle Paul, my dad’s friend, picked us up from the airport and drove us up to his farm in Pecos.\nHis wife Tina cooked us a delicious dinner and we got to know his sons Ryan and Kyle. My dad and I spent the night in the guestroom of the farm house listening to the frogs and water rolling down the river nearby. Very early in the morning, Uncle Paul woke us up to have breakfast. \"The day starts at dawn on my farm,\" he said. After breakfast, I went to help Aunt Tina feedthe chickens. while my dad went with Uncle Paul to take the sheep out to graze(吃草). I was impressed to see my dad and Uncle Paul riding horses. They looked really cool.\nIn the afternoon, I asked Uncle Paul if I could take a horse ride, and he said yes, as long as my dad went with me. I wasn’t going to take a horse ride by myself anyway. So, my dad and I put on our new cowboy hats, got on our horses, and headed slowly towards the mountains. \"Don’t be late for supper,\" Uncle Paul cried, \"and keep to the track so that you don’t get lost!\" \"OK! \" my dad cried back. After a while Uncle Paul and his farm house were out of sight. It was so peaceful and quiet and the colors of the brown rocks, the deep green pine trees, and the late afternoon sun mixed to create a magic scene. It looked like a beautiful woven(编织的）blanket spread out upon the ground just for us.\nSuddenly a little rabbit jumped out in front of my horse. This unexpected appearance frightened my horse, which made it run wildly. I tried my best to control it, but in vain. Frightened as I was, I tried to keep my balance to prevent myself from falling off. Fortunately, minutes later, the horse stopped before a river, out of breath, and so did I. At that moment, my dad also came up. Seeing I was OK, he was quite relieved. But it was clear that we got lost.\nWe had no idea where we were and it got dark. We didn’t know where the farm house was. What we could do was to go back along the previous track slowly. But it was really difficult for us in such a dark situation. Just as we were at the point of desperation, we heard a faint voice from the distance. “It must be Uncle Paul,” I said. So we cried back with excitement. Finally, Uncle Paul safely brought us back home. What an amazing ride!",

In 2019，the California­based company Gateway Foundation first explored the idea. Its dream was to make visiting space，in excellent accommodation，a future vacation choice. The project，now called Voyager Station，is run by Orbital Assembly Corporation，a construction company led by head of the Gateway Foundation and former pilot，John Blincow.\n\nSpace tourism draws closer as Orbital Assembly Corporation has announced plans to build the world's first space hotel named “Voyager Station”，which is expected to open in 2027. With a date in close sight，the hotel's architects and engineers are hard at work，aiming to design an out­of­this­world experience. They plan to decorate the suites with elegant bars and restaurants with a touch of space，as well as Earth­viewing lounges and unique space food treats. The team is also taking advantage of the reduced gravity that will be felt in the station to plan to let their guests weightlessly carry heavy objects，jump higher or run faster in ways people can't normally do on Earth.\n\nGravity will remain in the rooms and bars though because Voyager Station's scientific design makes it possible by creating artificial gravity within the hotel. The hotel is designed as a wheel that will steadily move and create simulated gravitational force，much like when a glass of water is spun around，the water doesn't pour out.

There was nothing to it. Jenna and Jeff knew exactly what to do.\nThe big day came at last. The alarm rang at 6 a.m. The pair went down the stairs quietly to the kitchen. They decided to boil the porridge first. They put some rice into a pot of water and left it to boil while they made the French toast. Jeff broke two eggs into a plate and added in some milk. Jenna found the bread and put two slices into the egg mixture. Next, Jeff turned on the second stove burner to heat up the frying pan. Everything was going smoothly until Jeff started frying the bread. The pan was too hot and the bread turned black within seconds. Jenna threw the burnt piece into the sink and put in the other slice of bread. This time, she turned down the fire so it cooked nicely.\nThen Jeff noticed steam shooting out of the pot and the lid starting to shake. The next minute, the porridge boiled over and put out the fire. Jenna panicked. Thankfully, Jeff stayed calm and turned off the gas quickly. But the stove was a mess now. Jenna told Jeff to clean it up so they could continue to cook the rest of the porridge. But Jeff’s hand touched the hot burner and he gave a cry of pain. Jenna made him put his hand in cold water. Then she caught the smell of burning. Oh dear! The piece of bread in the pan had turned black as well.\nAs the twins looked around them in disappointment, their father appeared. Father’s appearing was like a savior to the two children. Under the guidance of their father, they took positive actions and started all over again. They made the bread and then went on cooking porridge. Father helped them adjust the fire, which was the key to success. It was all right this time. Delicious breakfast was ready. How happy they were!\nThe twins carried the breakfast upstairs and woke their mother up. When their mother saw the delicious and perfect breakfast in front of her, she was very surprised.

  "23a5cfa0": "Tobogganing, or sledding (乘雪橇), likely comes before the colonization of North America. Records show that Canada's First Peoples used small sleds to transport their belongings and food between camps, Raymond Flower writes in The History of Skiing and Other Winter Sports. But modern­day sled races can trace their origins back to the Swiss Alps in the late 1800s when British tourists decided to race in wooden luges (a sled used by one person) that locals had used to travel through snow. The origin is debatable in snowy northern New York, however, where there's evidence that Albany held bobsled (a sled used by two or more people) races as early as 1885.\n\nWherever they began, sled races quickly became popular. The famous Cresta Run, named after the Swiss town near the base of its course, was built in 1885 using snowbanks. The first organized competition was in 1898, hosted by the first bobsled club in nearby St. Moritz (a city in Switzerland)．It was then that sledding began to separate from the luge to include two new sports: bob sledding, and skeleton sledding (俯式雪橇)．\n\nCresta Run is considered the birthplace of the skeleton, a particularly daring form of sledding. Unlike the luge, where competitors ride feet­first on a sled with metal runners, the skeleton sledding is a steel sled with a slim appearance. Riders lie down on the sled head­first, then drop suddenly down an ice track. Bobsledding, meanwhile, involves teams of two to four in which the person in front controls directions and the player in back brakes when needed. It earned its name after competitors started swinging back and forth to speed up the sled.\n\nBobsledding initially overtook skeleton sledding in popularity, becoming one of a handful of sports played at the first Winter Games in 1924. The skeleton sledding was limited to the Cresta Run for decades because other bob runs around the world were not built for the steel skeleton sled. But in the 1970s, adjustments were made to both the skeleton and bob runs in order to include the event at future winter games.\n",

Especially for children，museums introduce them to unknown worlds，inspire their imagination and provide them with valuable learning experiences. It's generally believed that museums only help fuel academic education. But in fact，they provide knowledge regarding all walks of life.\n\nMuseums offer children bigger connections and references to history than a traditional class. They play a huge role in impacting their historical knowledge and the innovation taking place before their eyes. Parents themselves don't have to be history lovers. Just reading out to them，encouraging them to ask questions and holding their attention.\n\nMuseums are a collection of resources that promote informal education. Individuals acquire values，knowledge，and skills that are not applicable to the only field but will aid them for a lifetime. A single visit to a museum near you will provide children with in­depth knowledge about different subjects that they can acquire slowly，for museums let you stay as long as you want.\n\nMuseums are well enough equipped to awaken curiosity in young minds，which in turn will lead to these children asking questions. Some of these questions may have immediate answers. Some of them might need a great deal of thought to answer and some of them might not have any answers at all. No matter what they asked，all of these questions must be equally encouraged and children must be given the confidence to find the answers to them on their own.\n\nMuseums have the ability to leave its visitors in awe of the huge amount of information it holds. They provide inspiration to young children via its resources that leave them fascinated about the night sky and the solar system，the skeletons that keep them thinking about life before them，the artworks that arouse the creative mind，etc. All in all，museums encourage children to dream and wonder.\n",
  "25b33625": "A walk in the park may be just what the doctor ordered. A new program launched last month in Canada gives some doctors the option of providing patients with a free annual pass to the country's national parks as part of an effort to increase access to nature and the health benefits.\n\nPaRx, a health initiative launched by the BC Parks Foundation in 2019, partnered with Parks Canada to provide doctors across four provinces with an initial run of 100 passes that can be prescribed (开处方)．The program allows doctors to write more general prescriptions for time spent out in nature; two hours a week, at least 20 minutes at a time, is what PaRx director Dr. Melissa Lem suggests.\n\n“Given the growing body of evidence that indicates nature time can improve all kinds of different physical and mental health conditions, we're hoping that our PaRx program not only improves patient health, but reduces costs to the health­care system, and helps to grow the number of people who are more engaged environmental advocates,” said Prama Rahman, a coordinator for the BC Parks Foundation.\n\nDoctors have been catching on, instructing their patients to turn to nature to improve their health and they're getting creative in how they do it. Dr. Robert Zarr, a doctor based in Washington, began prescribing accessible outdoor activities for his young patients and even created a searchable online database of local parks to make it easier.\n\nBut getting outside isn't always as easy as it might sound. Income can affect one's access to nature, an issue that PaRx is trying to address in Canada. Doctors  utilizing  the new national parks pass program are urged to prioritize patients who might not otherwise be able to afford these passes.\n\nWhile only 100 adult passes, which give holders access to more than 80 national parks, historic sites and nature reserves, have initially been made available, organizers plan to routinely reassess this number as the program grows, the BC Parks Foundation told NPR.\n\n\n5．What is PaRx intended to do?\n\nA．Qualify doctors to prescribe.\n\n_B．Give patients free access to parks.\n\nC．Promote free admission to parks.\n\nD．Advocate 20 minutes' walk a day.\n\n\n\n7．What can we infer from the last paragraph?\n\nA．The BC Parks Foundation is expanding rapidly.\n\nB．The program has signed up 80 national parks.\n\n_C．More people will benefit from the program.\n\nD．Those living close to parks can gain priority.\n\n\n\n",

Jurgis Vilnius，owner of the building immediately called the post office.“I'm so happy they got interested，” said he.\n\nStreet names and their numbering have changed in Vilnius，and post office workers spent months looking for the right houses and talking to current renters and neighbors，tracking down where the recipients moved to. Only five were found. In several cases children of late recipients were handed a lost letter.\n\n“We felt a moral duty to do this，” said Deimante Zebrauskaite，head of the customer experience department at Lithuania Post.\n\nOne lady compared the experience to receiving a message from a bottle thrown into the sea. People were emotional.“Some felt they saw a part of daily life of their deceased parents，” Zebrauskaite said.\n\nIn the letter to Klonovska，sent from Koezary in Poland and stamped in 1970，a girl named Ewa complains buses no longer reach her village，so she has to walk in minus 23 degree Celsius cold，and asks for pictures of actors.\n\nNow in her 60s，Klonovska has no memory of Ewa. She probably wrote Ewa after finding her address advertising for pen pals in a newspaper，and the relationship ceased after the letter got undelivered.\n\n“So good that the letter didn't matter much. The loss was not life­changing，” said Klonovska. “What if they delivered a lost letter from a suitor (求婚者) to his love，and their wedding never happened？”\n\n1．What does the underlined word “pranking” in paragraph 1 mean?\n\nA．Brightening.　　　　　\tB．Embarrassing.\n\n_C．Tricking. \tD．Pleasing.\n\n\n2．What happened to the letters in paragraph 2?\n\n_A．They were accidentally found.\n\nB．They remained well­preserved.\n\nC．They were delivered by the former post office.\n\nD．They were hidden by the owner of the building.\n\n\n3．Which of the following best describes the present post office in Vilnius?\n\nA．Generous. \t_B．Dutiful.\n\nC．Honest. \tD．Cautious.\n\n4．What can we learn from what Klonovska said?\n\nA．Klonovska refused a suitor.\n\nB．Klonovska stopped the wedding.\n\nC．The undelivered letter ruined the relationship.\n\n_D．The undelivered letter made little difference to her.\n",

  "4395c479": "When Ken was in high school，he did well and had a strong sense of accomplishment. However，when he is in college，his grades are not so outstanding among academically gifted students much like himself，if not better. Often he feels depressed and is withdrawing from people and activities. Unfortunately，he is no exception. The literature generally has found that many of us tend to let our self­worth be contingent (依情况而定的)upon external events(such as academics and physical attractiveness)．When our self­worth depends on those，it's unstable. As a result，our feelings about ourselves can end up being in the hands of others.\n\nObviously，we all want to experience things that make us feel good. But when we have contingent self­worth，we might engage in activities that make us feel worthy while avoiding activities that make us feel unworthy. That may pose potential dangers. Instead of working hard to meet our goals，we'll try to avoid failure. And if we do fail one day，we might abandon our goals，lose motivation，or make excuses to help ourselves feel better.\n\nLet's cite some examples to further demonstrate that. If our self­worth is contingent upon being successful at work，we might only choose jobs that are easy. That way we never fail and ensure that we always know that we are worthy. Or，maybe we only think we're worthy if we weigh less than 50 kg. We might undereat or engage in unhealthy eating practices just to make sure that we feel good.\n\nSelf­worth is an important psychological construct that affects not only how we think about ourselves but it also has an impact on our psychological health and functioning. So，give up the idea of seeking approval from others. Instead，learn to base your self­worth on internal contingencies like virtues and faiths. Doing so reminds us to be fully aware of who we are.\n",
  "47626b56": "\nOn a break from his studies in the MIT Media Lab, Anirudh Sharma traveled home to Mumbai, India. While there, he noticed that throughout the day his T­shirts were gradually gathering something that looked like dirt. “I realized this was air pollution, or sooty (烟尘覆盖的) particulate matter (PM), made of black particles released from exhaust (尾气) of vehicles，” Sharma says.“This is a major health issue.” Soot consists of tiny black particles, about 2.5 micrometers or smaller, made of carbon produced by incomplete burning of fossil fuels.\n\nBack at MIT, Sharma set out to help solve this air­pollution issue. After years of research and development, Sharma's start­up Graviky Labs has developed technology that attaches to exhaust systems of diesel generators to collect particulate matter. Scientists at Graviky then turn it into ink, called Air­Ink, for artists around the world. So far, the start­up has collected 1.6 billion micrograms of particulate matter. More than 200 gallons of Air­Ink have been harvested for a growing community of more than 1,000 artists, from Bangalore to Boston, Shanghai，and London.\n\nPosted all over Graviky Labs' social media platform page today are photos of art made from Air­Ink and paints, including street wall paintings, body art and clothing prints. At first, there was still no specific application for the ink. Then the start­up decided to find new ways to further spread its mission. It chose to do so through art. “Art helps us raise awareness about where the ink and paints come from. Air pollution knows no borders. Our ink sends a message that pollution is the one of the resources in our world that's the hardest to collect and use. But it can be done，” Sharma says.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

One truth about life is that we can't spend it alone to live the journey.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, my left leg was injured. The doctor declared it a serious injury, and I would be in bed for three months. As a full­time social worker, I hardly had time to visit my home. However, my broken leg stopped all my work, which was bad and also good, giving me an opportunity to spend time with myself and my family.\n\nI was upset. How would I spend three months in bed at home? Early in my injury and before my operation, there were so many ups and downs in my confidence. So many times, negative thoughts bothered me.\n\nI felt very depressed but each time I got support from my family and friends. I decided to change my lifestyle according to the situation. It was not so simple or easy. I began to practice thinking deeply in silence, read books, and talk with friends. I even planted various plants to help me heal. It was relaxing to water them.\n\nEventually, I am fully recovered, feeling relaxed. At the time of struggle and tough situations, we feel the need of someone who can spend time with us. Their kind presence gives us so much strength and support. They just meet in our heart and family, and just need our love and friendship.\n",

Arthur continued, “Sorry for not telling you timely. I was too frightened.”\n\nJay was silent for a minute before saying in a kind voice, “You think it is the right thing to cover up for your brother？” Arthur went pale, wide­eyed. Jay explained that his brother had admitted how he had ridden Arthur's motorcycle and lost control， resulting in the accident. Arthur asked anxiously， “Will he be arrested？” “No, just a small dent.” Seeing Arthur's relieved expression, he went on, “I hope，however， your brother will learn from this. As for you, remember that it is unwise to hide the truth.”\n\nArthur thanked him and set off home. He was proud of his brother's courage in admitting everything.

  "6667af8b": "There is a time when many Americans question whether a college degree is worth its cost. However，a recent study found Americans who completed college or university are more likely to have friends and are less lonely than those who only finished high school.\n\nDaniel Cox，director of the Survey Center on American Life，said that in general Americans are experiencing a “friend recession”，meaning a decline in their number of friends. Cox noted “Americans have fewer close friends today than we did in the early 1990s. But men and those without a college degree are particularly affected because they seem to have experienced a much more dramatic decline over that period”．\n\nThe Center questioned 5,054 people this past summer. It found Americans with a college degree feel more socially connected and are more active in their communities than people who didn't go to college. As a result，those who completed college report feeling less lonely.\n\nPrevious research showed that Americans who didn't go to college are less likely to marry. A study found that college­educated women are much more likely to get married than women who dropped out of high school. Another study of people born between 1957 and 1964 found that both men and women who didn't finish high school are less likely to marry than those with more education.\n\nToday,65 percent of college­educated Americans over age 25 are married. About 50 percent of people with a high school diploma, or who dropped out of high school，are married. Those numbers were different in 1990, when marriage rates among the college graduates were at 69 percent，compared with 63 percent for those who did not go to college, says a Pew research report.\n\nThe American Community Life Survey found around 1 in 10 college graduates say they have no close social connections. That number rises among Americans without a degree，where almost 1 in 4 say they have no close friends.\n\n\n",
  "6b302206": "Sometime in the early 1960s，a significant thing happened in Sydney，Australia. The city discovered its harbor. Then，one after another，Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there—broad parks，superb beaches，and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.\n\nAndrew Reynolds，a cheerful fellow in his early 30s，pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine，and we went our separate ways—he for a lunch break，I to explore the city.\n\n“I'll miss these old boats，” he said as we parted.\n\n“How do you mean？” I asked.\n\n“Oh，they're replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster，but they're not so elegant，and they're not fun to pilot. But that's progress，I guess.”\n\nEverywhere in Sydney these days，change and progress are the watchwords (口号)，and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald，the city's official historian，told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s，Sydney swept aside much of its past，including many of its finest buildings.“Sydney is confused about itself，” she said.“We can't seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It's a conflict that we aren't getting any better at resolving (解决)．”\n\nOn the other hand，being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony.“Many people say that we lack culture in this country，” he told me.“What people forget is that the Italians，when they came to Australia，brought 2,000 years of their culture，the Greeks some 3,000 years，and the Chinese more still. We've got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It's a pretty hard combination to beat.”\n\nHe is right，but I can't help wishing they would keep those old ferries.\n\n\n",

  "6ea57e6e": "\n5G mobile technology has officially begun rolling out across the globe，which indicates a dynamic acceleration (加速) in our world of connectivity. It promotes operational cooperation tourism hasn't experienced before. It also transforms the travel experience.\nThis is perceived from both the way the industry operates and the side of the traveler.\n\n5G opens up a new way of accessing information and delivering business value. It's expected to offer organizations a wireless network that transforms the way people and machines use data. Unlike previous network generations,5G is now being seen as not just a consumer platform，but a primary communications platform that can also provide cloud connectivity and edge processing that can offer real­time business insights and automated responses，and eventually integrate the billions of Internet of things devices and data that are available.\n\nAs travel companies have transformed their operations with new digital systems，their focus has moved from the technology itself to the improved business outcomes and enhanced guest and passenger experiences driven by the technology. 5G's capabilities can support that change. With advanced connectivity speeds and low latency(延时)，guests can share their personal data to receive custom recommendations from travel companies in real time that should provide meaningful experiences. Virtual experiences give guests an early taste of the destination. For example，guests can involve themselves in viewing rooms and hotel facilities，or preview local attractions as they plan their trips.\n\nTo prepare to roll out this new technology，travel companies should ensure they have a thorough understanding of their guests' expectations on what makes a first­rank travel experience. Then they should find ways to adapt their processes and services to meet them.\n\n\n",
  "7064f6d4": "Great inventors like Thomas Edison have impacted people's lives with their inventions. While their contributions are certainly valuable, the following amazing inventions were actually created by children!\n\n## The trampoline\n\nTrampolines are great for both fun and exercise, but they are a fairly recent invention. In the 1930s, George Nissen was inspired to make a bouncy “net” after seeing a circus performance. He thought it more entertaining for performers to continue bouncing instead of landing in a net. So, at the age of 16, he made it by stretching thick cloth in a metal frame.\n\n## The Popsicle\n\nCold weather led to the creation of a delicious invention—the Popsicle. Frank Epperson was just 11 years old when he accidentally created his first Popsicle. He was making himself a soda drink and left his glass outside overnight. When he found it in the morning, it had frozen solid with the stir stick still in the glass. And the first Popsicle was born.\n\n## Braille\n\nThree-year-old Louis Braille experienced a serious eye injury that blinded him in both eyes. He struggled to read by moving his fingers across raised letters, but that proved very difficult. At the age of twelve, Louis learned about a communication system where messages could be read silently with fingertips. He changed it and created Braille. It's now used around the world!\n\n## BEACON\n\nWhen Hannah Herbst was just 14 years old, she was named America's Top Young Scientist for inventing a device called BEACON. After receiving a letter from her Ethiopian pen pal, Hannah was inspired to create a device that could convert the energy from ocean waves into electricity which she hopes will help people without easy access to electricity.\n\n",
  "7a7431cd": "A study of teenage girls' selfie­taking (自拍) behavior found that taking and sharing selfies on social media is not linked to poor body image or appearance concerns. However, when adolescent girls spend too much time struggling over which photo of themselves to post, or rely heavily on editing apps to alter their images, there may be cause for concern.\n\nThe study, by researchers at the University of Arizona(UA), found that selfie editing and time invested in creating and selecting the perfect selfie were both related to self­objectification, which led to body shame, appearance anxiety and more negative appearance evaluations in teen girls.“Self­objectification is the idea that you come to think of yourself as an external object to be viewed by other people,” said senior study author Jennifer Aubrey, an associate professor at the UA.\n\nBased on a study of 278 teenage girls,“Our main finding was that we really shouldn't be too worried about kids who take selfies and share them; that's not where the negative effects come from. It's the investment and the editing that yielded negative effects,” Aubrey said.“Selfie editing and selfie investment predicted self­objectification, and girls who self­objectify were more likely to feel shameful about their bodies or anxious about their appearance.”\n\n“Self­objectification is the pathway to so many things in adolescence that we want to prevent,” Aubrey said.“So, interventions really should focus on how we can encourage girls to develop an awareness of themselves that doesn't only depend on what they look like to other people.” The researchers said parents and caregivers of adolescent girls should be aware that if a teen seems to be obsessed (痴迷的), it might be time for a talk.\n\nThe researchers also note that there can be different motivations for sharing selfies.“Selfies are a part of the media landscape, but you should post them for reasons other than trying to get people to admire your appearance or your body,” Aubrey said. With an estimated 93 million selfies taken each day, they aren't going away anytime soon, nor should they. The important thing to remember is: Selfies aren't bad. Just don't obsess.\n\n7．From which is the text probably taken?\n\nA．A travel brochure.\n\n_B．A science newspaper.\n\nC．A psychology textbook.\n\nD．An entertainment magazine.\n",
  "7f663747": "Parents everywhere praise their kids. Jenn Berman, author of The A to Z Guide to Raising Happy and Confident Kids, says, \"We've gone to the opposite extreme of a few decades ago when parents tended to be more strict.\" By giving kids a lot of praise, parents think they're building their children's confidence, when, in fact, it may be just the opposite. Too much praise can backfire and, when given in a way that's insincere, make kids afraid to try new things or take a risk for fear of not being able to stay on top where their parents' praise has put them.\nStill, don't go too far in the other direction. Not giving enough praise can be just as damaging gas giving too much. Kids will feel like they're not good enough or that you don't care and, as a result, may see no point in trying hard for their accomplishments.\nSo what is the right amount of praise? Experts say that the quality of praise is more important than the quantity. If praise is sincere and focused on the effort not the outcome, you can give it as often as your child does something that deserves a verbal reward.\" We should especially recognize our children's efforts to push themselves and work hard to achieve a goal, \"says Donahue, author of Parenting Without Fear: Letting Go of Worry and Focusing on What Really Matters. \"One thing to remember is that it's the process not the end product that matters.\"\nYour son may not be the best basketball player on his team. But if he's out there every day and playing hard, you should praise his effort regardless of whether his team wins or loses. Praising the effort and not the outcome can also mean recognizing your child when she has worked hard to clean the yard, cook dinner, or finish a book report. But whatever it is, praise should be given on a case-by-case basis and be proportionate(相称的)to the amount of effort your child has put into it.\nCurrently, contrary to what people did in the past, many parents think highly of their kids too often. It is not proper to praise children too much, but they can't do the opposite. It is said that what matters is not the quantity but the quality of praise. All in all, parents are supposed to praise their children in promotion to how much effort they make.",

  "86efd66c": "At just 19 years old，Akiša Peters teaches at the Sisseton Wahpeton Tribal College. He specializes in a language that is thousands of years old，the Dakota language，spoken by the Dakota people.\n\n“The Dakota language is ‘the most important aspect' of Dakota culture. Without it，our Dakota culture would no longer exist！” Peters claimed.“I was lucky to grow up around many first­language Dakota speakers. But now the elderly continually passed away and at the end of their lives，they just wanted to know their families would continue to have the language. One of the problems our people have is finding ways to get at­length and consistent exposure to the language.”\n\nAside from instructing at the college level，Peters uses social media to share videos that integrate humor，culture，and basic­level conversation to help teach Dakota. In his free time，he visits Dakota elders. He also started an online group of youth to converse and share the knowledge of the language in a safe and supportive space.\n\nAkiša Peters wants to tell the youth that if they want to learn their own language，sit with their elders and learn from them. Endless vocabulary sheets could discourage them from learning. Standards created by non­speakers could also do that.“Within the next decade，I assume，me，my colleagues，and other Dakota­learning relatives will have children and start a new generation of Dakota. I also hope my brothers and sisters will take the path we laid out for them and continue to learn and speak Dakota. On my reservation there are numerous young people working on the comeback of the language. I'm hopeful because I'm definitely not alone，” Akiša Peters told Teen vogue.\n\n\n5．Why does Akiša Peters teach the Dakota language?\n\nA．To enrich his experience.\n\nB．To record its written form.\n\n_C．To prevent it dying out.\n\nD．To make it known globally.\n\n\n6．What can we say about Akiša Peters according to paragraph 3?\n\nA．Learned. \t_B．Creative.\n\nC．Approachable. \tD．Cooperative.\n\n\n7．What does Akiša Peters expect the young people to do?\n\nA．Deal with vocabulary sheets.\n\nB．Sustain the given standards.\n\n_C．Communicate with their elders.\n\nD．Learn from their teachers.\n\n\n8．Which section of a website is the text probably taken from?\n\nA．Research.

  "8bc0879e": "As a young boy, I loved being active. All I really wanted to do was to put on my football shoes and play out with my friends. As I've got older, my love for physical activity hasn't declined. This is why I was so eager to be involved in the Creating Active Schools framework as a PE teacher.\n\nIn the early stages of my time at Peel Park Primary, my two main aims were to reform the PE course and to increase our participation in competitive sports. We achieved these successfully in a short time.\n\nJust as I'll never love art, many of our pupils will never love football or tennis. That's why finding a way to move, which works for each child, is vital. What we can do is get opportunities for every child to love being physically active.\n\nWe therefore opened our own school Bike Library. We have already received many rental requests. We also thought about how to arrange the school day, allowing all children to access our equipment freely and easily. Besides, we also have a “PA” lesson which has a total free choice for the children. They can swing on the trees, go on the bikes and play games with their friends. This change from thinking has improved participation in the “traditional PE” from pupils, who typically didn't love sports. A win­win situation!\n\nNow I'm looking forward to our next step on this journey to improving pupils' lives. The potential of this project as it expands, is huge.",

  "8ffc0429": "Twelve prized camels have been disqualified from a beauty contest in Saudi Arabia after their owners tried to beautify their looks with Botox (肉毒杆菌素)．\n\nThousands of camels are paraded at the King Abdulaziz Camel Festival to be judged on their shapely lips and humps. The festival，which also features camel racing and camel milk tasting，has combined prize money of $57 million.\n\nThis year's event has been stuck in scandal after the 20 million Saudi riyals in prize money for each category tempted some owners to cheat.\n\nThe key features in camel beauty are considered to be delicate ears and a big nose. Judges are also looking for perfectly placed humps，muscular physiques and leathery mouths. But there are strict rules against the use of drugs in the lips，or shaved or clipped body parts.\n\nAli Al Mazrouei，the son of a top Emirati breeder，said Botox was used for the lips，the nose and even the jaw.“It makes the head more inflated，so when the camel comes，it's like ‘Oh look at how big that head is. It has big lips，a big nose’，” he said.\n\nIn the lead up to the festival，Saudi media reported that a vet had been caught giving camels plastic surgery including Botox injections and reducing the size of their ears.\n\nChief judge Fawzan Al­Madi said the camel was “a symbol of Saudi Arabia”．“We used to preserve it out of necessity; now we preserve it as a pastime，” he said. The camel beauty contest was first held in 2000 and last year was relocated from a remote desert area to a permanent venue north of the capital，Riyadh.\n\n4．Why did some people cheat in the camel beauty contest?\n\n_A．Because they wanted to get the big prize.\n\nB．Because they intended to show off their camels.\n\nC．Because they were proud of their camels' humps.\n\nD．Because they expected their camels to win in racing.\n\n5．What is focused in the fourth paragraph?\n\nA．The goal of the contest.\n\nB．The rules for the judges.\n\n_C．The standards of judgement.\n\nD．The kinds of different camels.\n\n\n6．Which of the following isn't considered a feature of camel beauty?\n\nA．Big lips.　　　　　　　\t_B．Big ears.\n\nC．Big heads. \tD．Big noses.\n\n\n7．What can we infer from the last paragraph?\n\nA．Arabians find it tiring to raise camels.\n\nB．People in Saudi Arabia depend on camels to live.\n\n_C．Saudi government takes the camel festival seriously.\n\nD．Camels were raised for fun in the past in Saudi Arabia.\n",
  "9096d731": "The Meredith family lived in a small community. As the economy was in decline, some people in the town had lost their jobs. Many of their families were struggling to make ends meet. People were trying to help each other meet the challenges.\nMrs. Meredith was a most kind and thoughtful woman. She spent a great deal of time visiting the poor. She knew they had problems, and they needed all kinds of help. When she had time, she would bring food and medicine to them.\nOne morning she told her children about a family she had visited the day before. There was a man sick in bed, his wife, who took care of him and could not go out to work, and their little boy. The little boy -his name was Bernard-had interested her very much.\n“I wish you could see him,” she said to her own children, John, Harry, and Clara. “He is such a help to his mother. He wants very much to earn some money, but I don't see what he can do.”\nAfter their mother left the room, the children sat thinking about Bernard. “I wish we could help him to earn money,” said Clara. “His family is suffering so much.”\n“So do I,” said Harry. “We really should do something to assist them.”\nFor some moments, John said nothing, but, suddenly, he sprang to his feet and cried, “I have a great idea! I have a solution that we can all help accomplish(完成).”\nThe other children also jumped up all attention. When John had an idea, it was sure to be a good one. “I tell you what we can do,” said John. “You know that big box of corn Uncle John sent us? Well, we can make popcorn(爆米花), and put it into paper bags, and Bernard can take it around to the houses and sell it.”\nWhen Mrs. Meredith heard of John’s idea, she thought it was a good one, too. So, they went to the local supermarket together. They bought a bag of corn and some special bags for popcorn. When they got home, they made a lot of popcorn and put it in the special bags. With the popcorn, they went to Bernard’s home. They told Bernard how to sell the popcorn. Bernard and his parents were very grateful. And the Meredith family also felt very happy to help this family.\nWith everything ready, Bernard started out on his new business. He took the popcorn around to the houses and sold all his popcorn. He earned a lot of money. Then, he wanted to be self-dependent. Therefore, he asked Mrs. Meredith to teach him how to make popcorn. After that, not only did he sell popcorn, but he also added cream and salt to the popcorn to make it taste better. Bernard grew up to be a remarkable man. He did not forget the help of Meredith’s family, and he also did what he could to help those in need.",
  "972c960f": "Do we still need cash? The days of holding notes in our hands may be numbered. The advancement of technology and the increase of new electronic and mobile devices in today's world are set to revolutionize how we make payments. With a click of a mobile phone app，our entire wealth is literally at our fingertips. As digital forms are increasingly replacing cash payments，some think that we should become fully cash­free. However，I do not believe we should move towards a completely cash­free society.\n\nOne of the main concerns of a cashless world is the risk of a cheat and ridiculously，the inconvenience that follows. The instant content that accompanies cashless transactions (交易) could be compromised by online security issues. Technology experts argue that our current state of technology is unable to provide a secure cashless environment that could prevent people from accessing the system illegally and abusing the personal data. In addition，many online shopping sites lack strong systems that would protect their customers' personal information. Occasionally，when an account is “locked” due to a suspected cheating activity, having cash in hand becomes critical. In a cashless society，a victim of cheating would find himself locked out of his account and unable to have access to his money until the case is solved. Going cash­free causes great inconvenience in this case.\n\nAnother reason is that mankind might potentially become less thrifty (节俭的). Paying in cash causes a psychological pain on consumers so that they are more cautious in their spending. As it is，cashless payments have already eased that pain somewhat. Thus，an even more careless digital payment could make us much less thrifty.\n\nThe idea of a cashless society is a very real，or even an exciting one. However，to safeguard the interests of all users，it is better to soften our enthusiasm—perhaps to be a less­cash society rather than a completely cashless one is a better option.\n\n",
  "9ee04414": "In some snow­covered villages in Altay district of Xinjiang，it's common in winter to see local herdsmen (牧民) with planks attached to their feet climb the snowy slopes without any other form of assistance. The pair of planks are wrapped with horsehide (马皮)，which serves a double purpose. Remarkably，the horsehide not only can provide friction to prevent skiers from slipping while going up the hills，but also helps them slide more smoothly down the hills.\n\nAccording to rock carvings uncovered in the area by archaeologists，such skis have served for around 12,000 years as a means of transportation for the snowfield people of Altay，especially those who had to travel a long way in the snow to herd animals or hunt. The fur skis gradually lost their popularity in recent decades after paved roads linked houses to the outside world. However，in response to the nation's goal of brightening up grassroots enthusiasm for ice and snow sports，Altay plans to protect and promote its skiing culture and better pass along its skiing tradition to future generations.\n\nSilambek Sakish,67，a herdsman in the village of Altay，began to learn the craft at the age of 15 from his father. He would cut high­quality pine into a plank and then bend the plank's front end after the wood was heated in a fire. Wrapping the plank with horsehide was the last step.\n\nSakish was honored as an heritor of the craft of making fur skis in 2010，which had been assigned as an intangible (非物质) cultural heritage of Xinjiang. His works are exhibited in ski places，airports and train stations across Altay and also at the display center for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics to promote the district's deep historical connection to skiing. More young people have come to him to learn the craft，and his youngest son，who is 31，has followed in his footsteps to carry on the tradition.\n\n\n\n",

  "bcb79528": "Many people think that there should be some sort of universal service around cash，forcing banks to provide it and sellers to accept it. I disagree，but I do understand why they think that forcing the additional costs associated with cash on financial institutions and merchants seems appealing.\n\nOne of their arguments is that cash is a necessary fallback，the only payment method that society can depend on in the event of nuclear war or natural disaster and therefore businesses should be forced to keep the ability to distribute and collect notes and coins. They think that cash is the backup in a disaster. It really isn't. When things go really wrong，it is the people who keep their money in cash who suffer the most.\n\nRemember the Japanese disaster of a decade back，where following a severe earthquake off the northeast coast of Japan's Honshu Island in 2011，a huge tsunami (海啸) towering a hundred feet above the ground went crashing into cities，towns and villages destroying more than 500 square kilometers. Since Japan remains a cash­based society and a great many people keep their savings in cash in their homes，the disaster led to the unusual phenomenon of safes and cash washing up on beaches. Yasuo Kimura，a former bank employee then aged 67，said that he had many friends who lost everything.“I had tried to convince them to put their money in a bank，” he said.“They always thought it was safer to keep it at home.”\n\nAnother argument they make is that electronic payment can be bad for privacy，making cash remain the best backup. They ask “How do you stop data thieves and data brokers from monitoring your buying history？” and suggest paying in cash is the answer. Personally，I think using privacy-enhancing technologies when making electronic payments is a better answer，but that's a discussion for another day.\n\n5．What makes many people think it necessary to force cash service on banks?\n\nA．The duty of banks.\n\n_B．The reliability of cash.\n\nC．The need to cut costs.\n\nD．The demand from sellers.\n\n\n6．What was one of the results of the Japanese disaster in 2011?\n\nA．The quake destroyed over 500 square kilometers.\n\nB．100 towers were swallowed by the tsunami.\n\nC．Japanese started to keep money in banks.\n\n_D．Many Japanese lost their backup money.\n\n\n7．What does the author think of electronic payment?\n\nA．It is not good for privacy.\n\n_B．It still leaves much to be desired.\n\nC．It is safer than cash payment.\n\nD．It often falls into the wrong hands.\n\n\n8．What can be the best title for the text?\n\nA．Is E­payment Safe?\n\nB．Lessons from a Natural Disaster\n\n_C．Is Cash the Backup?\n\nD．Appeal of Universal Cash Service\n",
  "bdfa761b": "Edward O. Wilson, known as “ant man”， was born on June 10, 1929, in Birmingham, Alabama. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was moved frequently throughout his childhood. Wilson grew up exploring the forests and wildlife. One of these adventures left him partly blind, but they also set off his lifelong fascination with ants and their social structures.\n\nWilson earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Alabama. In 1955, he received his Ph. D. from Harvard and worked there until retirement.\n\nWilson's early study of ants led to his first major discovery in 1959: how ants communicate through the release of chemical signals.\n\nLater, in 1990, Wilson and German biologist Bert Hölldobler published their Pulitzer­winning The Ants. It detailed the insects' social structure that was both valued by scholars and accessible to general readers.\n\nAnother of Wilson's major works started in the early 1960s when he teamed up with Robert MacArthur. The pair published The Theory of Island Biogeography, where they sought to explain why different places have different numbers of species.\n\nWhat many consider to be Wilson's most important contributions to evolutionary biology came in 1975 when he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The work explored the genetic roots of animal behavior and argued that genes shaped human behavior.\n\nWilson faced accusations for these ideas but his work finally largely proved true. In 1978, his ideas on the role biology plays in human culture peaked in On Human Nature, which won him a Pulitzer in 1979.\n\nWilson published more than 400 scientific papers and 30 books. These accomplishments offered him a type of superstar status, but friends and colleagues said the polite Southerner remained down to earth. “Professor Wilson really listened to and engaged with whomever he was interacting with，”said Corrie S. Moreau, who was one of Wilson's final advisees.\n",

  "c0d0d8bc": "It was the day of the big cross-country run. Students from seven different primary schools in and around the small town were warming up and walking the route(路线)through thick evergreen forest.\nI looked around and finally spotted David, who was standing by himself off to the side by a fence. He was small for ten years old. His usual big toothy smile was absent today. I walked over and asked him why he wasn’t with the other children. He hesitated and then said he had decided not to run.\nWhat was wrong? He had worked so hard for this event!\nI quickly searched the crowd for the school’s coach and asked him what had happened. “I was afraid that kids from other schools would laugh at him,” he explained uncomfortably. “I gave him the choice to run or not, and let him decide.”\nI bit back my frustration(懊恼). I knew the coach meant well—he thought he was doing the right thing. After making sure that David could run if he wanted, I turned to find him coming towards me, his small body rocking from side to side as he swung his feet forward.\nDavid had a brain disease which prevented him from walking or running like other children, but at school his classmates thought of him as a regular kid. He always participated to the best of his ability in whatever they were doing. That was why none of the children thought it unusual that David had decided to join the cross-country team. It just took him longer—that’s all. David had not missed a single practice, and although he always finished his run long after the other children, he did always finish. As a special education teacher at the school, I was familiar with the challenges David faced and was proud of his strong determination.\nWe sat down next to each other, but David wouldn’t look at me. I said gently and quietly, “No one can change your mind, except yourself. If you desire to challenge yourself, there is nothing to do with others’ thoughts.” He sat still with a deep breath. “You have a full preparation before this event, which is the most important reason why you show up here”, I added with a sincere tone. Hearing my words, David turned to me tremblingly with tears spilling out of his eyes and expressed he had made a firm determination to finish the cross-country run. His coach heard what David said and gave me a look—the kind that was more determined than anyone else’s.\nI watched as David moved up to the starting line with the other runners. The race started. It seemed that the runway was extremely long for young children, not to mention a child with a heart disease. David insisted on running as if he had forgotten all his weaknesses, though he was tripped over within the a few kilometers. It didn’t take long before he picked himself up again and continued his mission. Classmates all appeared on the racing track, cheering for him. “Come on! You can make it! We are proud of you!” they shouted enthusiastically. To everyone’s joy, he reached the final line and ranked the 20th. It was no more important whether he won the first place or not. It was his brave heart and strong faith that could make something unusual happen finally.",

  "c507589d": "When Dr. Hendersonwas assigning （指定）project mates for his psychology class, I secretly hoped he would pair me with my best friend or at least a classmate I could have some fun with. Above all, I hoped he wouldn't assign\nme to work with the fiercely competitive, extremely seriousfellow who always wore dark clothes and apparently had a personality to match. As fate （命运）would have it, Dr. Henderson very deliberately matched everyone in class and announced that I would be working with the one person in class I wanted to avoid.\nI went up to my new teammate and introduced myself. He looked at me as though I weren't there. I felt he treated me as though I would hold him back and probably make him fail to get an A in the course. He wasn't mean or abusive; he just gave me the impression he could do whatever project we dreamed up better if he did it alone.\nNeedless to say, I didn't look forward to an entire term of being brushed off, but I tried to make the best of it and didn't say anything for fear that I would make things worse.\nThe project required each team to develop a hypothesis （｛段说）,set up an experiment to test the hypothesis, do the statistical analysis and present the findings. Whatever grade the team received would be shared by both students.\nWhen my teammate and I met to discuss our project, I was uneasy. Here was this challenging student who had a reputation for single-mindedness and good grades—the exact opposite of me. I was outmatched. I actually wanted to drop the class at one point, but stopped short because I didn't want to give him thesatisfaction of my chickening out. I decided to stick to it no matter what.\nAfter long discussions we somehow agreed to do a study on the psychological well-being of teenagers. I wasn't sure what it meant exactly, but at least we had a topic.\nWe started to meet regularly to draw up our plans. Though I wanted to share my ideas with him fully, I failed to do so for fear that I would hold him back. I just kept nodding when he asked me whether it is ok to do this way or that way. I thought it was impossible to persuade him into accepting my views, so I didn’t want to waste our time to discuss. I started to wait to leave immediately we arrived at the place, and so did he. I just hoped that the presentation day could come earlier.\nOne day I got word that he was admitted to hospital for a serious disease. I felt so sorry to hear that and I thought I should visit him in any case. He was a little surprised to see me when I stepped into his ward with some flowers and fruits. I offered to do the rest work of our projectand he invited me to share my ideas to perfect it. We began to work as a fine team and finally finished our project on time. Our hard work paid off and Dr. Henderson’s was very satisfied with our wonderful findings. From this project, we also learned the significance of teammates.

  "d186fb52": "Pumpkin (南瓜) carving at Halloween is a family tradition. We visit a local farm every October. In the pumpkin field, I compete with my three brothers and sister to seek out the biggest pumpkin. My dad has a rule that we have to carry our pumpkins back home, and as the eldest child I have an advantage-I carried an 85-pounder back last year.\nThis year, it was hard to tell whether my prize or the one chosen by my 14-year-old brother, Jason, was the winner. Unfortunately we forgot to weigh them before taking out their insides, but I was determined to prove my point. All of us were hard at work at the kitchen table, with my mom filming the annual event. I’m unsure now why I thought forcing my head inside the pumpkin would settle the matter, but it seemed to make perfect sense at the time.\nWith the pumpkin resting on the table, hole uppermost, I bent over and pressed my head against the opening. At first I got jammed just above my eyes and then, as I went on with my task, unwilling to quit, my nose briefly prevented entry. Finally I managed to put my whole head into it, like a cork (软木塞) forced into a bottle. I was able to straighten up with the huge pumpkin resting on my shoulders.\nMy excitement was short-lived. The pumpkin was heavy. “I’m going to set it down, now,” I said,and with Jason helping to supportits weight，I bent back over the table to give it somewhere to rest. It was only when I tried to remove my head that I realized getting out was going to be less straightforward than getting in. When I pulled hard, my nose got in the way. I got into a panic as I pressed firmly against the table and moved my head around trying to find the right angle, but it was no use. “I can’t get it out!” I shouted, my voice sounding unnaturally loud in the enclosed space.\nIt was five or six minutes though it felt much longer. Dad was summoned – less, it seemed, in expectation of practical help than to make sure he didn’t miss out on the spectacle. I heard him propose calling the fire department. “Stay tuned,” said Mom; she’d mentioned she was going to upload the video to Facebook, but it was only then I realized she’d been filming the whole time. The video cuts before my rescue —Dad got me to push my headfarther into the pumpkin so Mom could reach in and undo the rubber band round my ponytail. I emerged with squash-conditioned hair, a sore chin and my noseplugged with pulp.\nThe video was posted the Monday before Halloween. By the end of that day, it had over 1,000 views. People asked Mom to put it on YouTube, and by Wednesday morning we were getting 5:00 am calls from TV breakfast shows and then the international media – the video started racking up hundreds of thousands of views. When I went on a youth camp, I was recognized by children I’d never met. The pumpkin also became a minor celebrity. Passersby and trick-or-treaters would knock and ask, “Which is Rachel’s pumpkin?” before taking selfies with it.",

  "d3183aa4": "When I was in middle school, my social studies teacher asked me to enter a writing contest. I said no without thinking. I did not love writing. My family came from Brazil, so English was only my second language. Writing was so difficult and painful for me that my teacher had allowed me to present my paper on the sinking of the Titanic by acting out a play, where I played all the parts. No one laughed harder than he did.\nSo, why did he suddenly force me to do something at which I was sure to fail? His reply: “Because I love your stories. If you’re willing to apply yourself, I think you have a good shot at this.” Encouraged by his words, I agreed to give it a try.\nI chose Paul Revere’s horse as my subject. Paul Revere was a silversmith (银匠) in Boston who rode a horse at night on April 18, 1775 to Lexington to warn people that British soldiers were coming. My story would come straight from the horse’s mouth. Not a brilliant idea, but funny; and unlikely to be anyone else’s choice.\nWhat did the horse think, as he sped through the night? Did he get tired? Have doubts? Did he want to quit? I sympathized immediately. I got tired. I had doubts. I wanted to quit. But, like Revere’s horse, I kept going. I worked hard. I checked my spelling. I asked my older sister to correct my grammar. I checked out a half dozen books on Paul Revere from the library. I even read a few of them.\nWhen I handed in the essay to my teacher, he read it, laughed out loud, and said, “Great. Now, write it again.” I wrote it again, and again and again. When I finally finished it, the thought of winning had given way to the enjoyment of writing. If I didn’t win, I wouldn’t care.\nA few weeks later, when I almost forgot the contest, there came the news. I was informed that I won the first prize in the writing contest and that there would be an award presentation in two days. I was so happy to hear the news that I immediately shared it with my teacher. “I knew you’d win! I am proud of you. You made it!” he said excitedly. Then came the big day. When I was invited to the stage to receive the award, I expressed my thanks to my teacher. I said, “It’s you who make me fall in love with writing, my social studies teacher. Without your recognition and guidance, I couldn’t have written this article. Again thank you very much!”\nI went to my teacher’s office after the award presentation. My teacher was waiting for me. Holding my hands, he said “Congratulations! You are a good writer, so keep writing.” “You know I didn’t like writing before, but now I am crazy about it! I will try my best to create good works.” I said seriously. Since then, I have written many good works and now I am a famous writer. I owe my success to my social teacher who is a beacon in my life on the road to writing.",
  "d615ce97": "I needed to do something in my community (社区) in order to complete the community service hours required to graduate from high school. Some of my friends had signed up to spend time at a soup kitchen, so I did, too. It seemed like a good thing to do.\nI thought that we would just be passing out dinners to those in need, but I found out we would be doing everything from preparing to serving the dinner. We began preparing the food, from mixing salad dressing to separating frozen meat. Much still needed to be done before dinner was served, but already outside the building many homeless people were gathering. It wasn’t until a couple of hours later that we opened the doors and began serving dinner.\nAs the line of people came toward me, I got a little scared. I’d come face to face with the homeless: How should I act? How would they treat me? Would they hate me for having more than they did? While some of the people looked very friendly, some of them looked so dangerous. I didn’t have too much time to worry about it. I was assigned (分配) to serve the salad with the lady next to me. She smiled at me and said if I needed help, she’d be right there, which I found quite comforting.\nI had never seen so many people wanting food. They were of all ages and nationalities. Most of them wore clothes that were torn and dirty. Some looked like they had tally given up on life, while others seemed to be making the best of the situation, smiling and joking. Some were better off than others, but they all needed a good meal and a warm place to eat. It saddened me to think of how many people there were who didn’t have a place to call home and the only food they got came from a soup kitchen.\nAs they came in my direction I put on my brightest and happiest smile. I wanted to make them know that I was really anxious to help them. To my relief, they smiled politely back at me when they saw my smile, and I could see their exhaustion in their eyes. I wanted to know what they were going through and I was desperate to know what I could do for them. They nodded gratefully as I pushed my spoon into the pot and took a large spoonful and poured it into their bowls.\nI was so happy that I had earned my service hours in this way. This experience made me realize that there are so many people in this world who need our help. It also made me realize that our small act of kindness can make them feel warm and make a great difference to them. I will never forget the way they looked at me when they were given food. I am anxious to urge the world to do everything possible to help those in need.",
  "d742bb36": "\nA wearable interactive display made of a flexible，breathable electronic fabric can display simple maps and text messages，potentially for use in future smart clothing，a research group reports in their latest paper.\n\nPrevious research has developed flexible thin­film displays that are rollable，foldable and stretchable. However，such electronics have not yet been successfully integrated into clothing. This is because it has proven challenging to design fabric displays that are both durable over time and easy to assemble over a large area.\n\nNow，Chinese scientists have woven bands of a new fabric display roughly 6 m long by 25 cm wide. To make the new fabric，polymer scientists Chen Peining and Peng Huisheng at Fudan University in Shanghai and their colleagues weave electrically transparent fibers into a flexible，breathable fabric. The fabric is about as bright as the average flat­screen TV. The researchers noted their prototype (雏形) was also significantly more durable than conventional flexible thin­film displays，making it more suitable for practical use. One likely application for this is wearable displays. The researchers integrated a touch­sensitive 16­button fabric keyboard，solar­energy­harvesting threads and battery fibers into their fabric to add interactivity and a power supply. They added electronics to wirelessly link it to a smartphone via a Bluetooth connection so users could send and receive messages on their sleeves，as well as see their real­time locations on a map.\n\nIn the future，smart clothing might help display messages from people with voice，speech and language problems. And it might even work in concert with devices that can decode (译解) complex brain waves to figure out what these people would like to say but cannot. However，“putting displays with 36 volts (伏特) directly on the body may potentially be a concern，” cautioned Bao，chemical engineer at Stanford University in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "e0ad3348": "Popularization has in some cases changed the original meaning of emotional (情感的) intelligence. Many people now misunderstand emotional intelligence as almost everything desirable in a person's makeup that cannot be measured by an IQ test，such as character，motivation，confidence，mental stability，optimism and “people skills”. Research has shown that emotional skills may contribute to some of these qualities，but most of them move far beyond skill­based emotional intelligence.\n\nWe prefer to describe emotional intelligence as a specific set of skills that can be used for either good or bad purposes. The ability to accurately understand how others are feeling may be used by a doctor to find how best to help her patients，while a cheater might use it to control potential victims. Being emotionally intelligent does not necessarily make one a moral person.\n\nAlthough popular beliefs regarding emotional intelligence run far ahead of what research can reasonably support，the overall effects of the publicity have been more beneficial than harmful. The most positive aspect of this popularization is a new and much needed emphasis on emotion by employers，educators and others interested in promoting social well­being. The popularization of emotional intelligence has helped both the public and researchers reevaluate the functionality of emotions and how they serve people adaptively in everyday life.\n\nAlthough the continuing popular appeal of emotional intelligence is desirable，we hope that such attention will excite a greater interest in the scientific and scholarly study of emotion. It is our hope that in coming decades，advances in science will offer new perspectives (视角) from which to study how people manage their lives. Emotional intelligence，with its focus on both head and heart，may serve to point us in the right direction.\n\n\n5．What is a common misunderstanding of emotional intelligence?\n\nA．It can be measured by an IQ test.\n\nB．It helps to exercise a person's mind.\n\nC．It includes a set of emotional skills.\n\n_D．It refers to a person's positive qualities.\n\n\n6．Why does the author mention “doctor” and “cheater” in paragraph 2?\n\nA．To explain a rule.\n\n_B．To clarify a concept.\n\nC．To present a fact.\n\nD．To make a prediction.\n\n\n7．What is the author's attitude to the popularization of emotional intelligence?\n\n_A．Favorable. \tB．Intolerant.\n\nC．Doubtful. \tD．Unclear.\n\n\n8．What does the last paragraph mainly talk about concerning emotional intelligence?\n\nA．Its appeal to the public.\n\n_B．Expectations for future studies.\n\nC．Its practical application.\n\nD．Scientists with new perspectives.\n",

  "f2535178": "According to the statistics shared by UNESCO，at least 43% of the total languages that are estimated as being spoken across the world are in danger of extinction. Moreover，many languages around the world have less than 1,000 speakers now. Linguists (语言学家) and researchers believe that by the end of the century，at least half of the world's languages will have died. This is troublesome，given that cultural identity and languages go hand in hand.\n\nLanguage activists and people who speak these endangered languages are fighting back tooth and nail. Scientists believe that digitalization might be our only hope to preserve some of these quickly disappearing languages in the online world.\n\nFor instance，Oxford University Press launched Oxford Global Languages a few years ago. It is an initiative that boosts “digitally underrepresented” languages. They are focused on promoting languages that might have close to a million speakers worldwide，yet have little or no online presence. Therefore，they have been creating digital dictionaries as a fundamental building block to help preserve them.\n\nThere have been countless other projects like this with the same aim. Another is the Rosetta Project，which aims to create a handheld digital library that will carry more than 1,500 languages. It will be appropriately sized to fit nicely into our hands，and will come with around 13,000 pages of information. It will also have a high life expectancy of anywhere between 2,000 and 10,000 years. Initiatives like these have as their primary objective to ensure the preservation of local languages long after their speakers have died.\n\nCountless languages are dying every day，and they will continue to perish as the remaining speakers die. Of course，we cannot merely rely on digitization to deal with worldwide language loss. However，it is a step in the right direction. These digital tools offer endangered languages an opportunity to bounce back and survive.\n\n\n1．What does the data in paragraph 1 mainly show?\n\n_A．Many languages are endangered.\n\nB．Culture determines language evolution.\n\nC．Human development results in fewer languages.\n\nD．Many linguists attempt to protect threatened languages.\n\n\n2．What does Oxford Global Languages try to do?\n\nA．Promote online courses of local languages.\n\nB．Publish paper dictionaries of global languages.\n\nC．Increase dying language speakers to a million.\n\n_D．Make certain languages available in digital form.\n\n\n3．What can we learn about the digital library to be created by the Rosetta Project?\n\nA．It is portable but has a short life.\n\nB．It is sponsored by Oxford University Press.\n\n_C．It provides protection for linguistic diversity.\n\nD．It contains automatically updated information.\n\n4．Which of the following can replace the underlined word “perish” in the last paragraph?\n\nA．Be enriched.\n_B．Be lost.\nC．Be acquired. \nD．Be invented\n",
  "f361460c": "If you're an un­decider，even the simplest decisions can make your pulse race. And big, life­changing choices can cause a state of breaking down. Here are some strategies for spending less time worrying about decisions.\n\n## Go for being good enough\n\nSince perfectionism and indecision often go hand in hand, you should be moving from a mindset that “only the best will do” to “being good enough is good enough”. It helps to reflect on your original goal. Did you begin the exhausting online shopping to find a toaster that could clean itself, roast carrots and also charge your cell phone? Or were you just looking for something that would brown your bread？Remembering your purpose can simplify the process.\n\n## Outsource (交外办理) decisions\n\nResearch has shown that choices weaken the willpower and lead to decision fatigue (疲劳). That's why indecisive people are advised to pick their “battles”．In other words, be choosy about choosing. When it comes to wine, for example, all I want is a good glass with dinner. So rather than studying which to choose, I leave the decision to my local wine store，asking it to send me a case of surprises once in a while.\n\n## The 90 percent rule\n\nWhen a yes­or­no decision has many pros and cons, try the “90 percent rule”. This involves evaluating an opportunity on a scale from 0 to 100. If your interest falls anywhere below 90 percent, reduce its score to zero and reject it. Think about how you'd feel if you scored 65 points on some test. Why would you deliberately choose to feel that way about an important choice in your life?\n\n## Cut through the fog\n\nIf you're deciding whether to move across the country, imagine you've asked your best friend to choose for you. On the big day, she hands you an envelope；inside, it announces you're leaving next month. Do you feel excited? Or disappointed? Using thought experiments to separate important variables can help you cut through the fog to see clarity\n",
  "f414515b": "\nFor people born into the Russian aristocracy (贵族) in the nineteenth century，life was full of interesting opportunities unless they were female. At the time，women generally did not have careers，for they were expected，instead，to focus fully on marrying and raising families. Sophia Behrs was one such young woman. When Sophia married Leo Tolstoy (列夫·托尔斯泰)，he was already a well­known author. Both the couple were literary in their interests：Sophia had been a gifted student and，even at a very young age，was a keen and sensitive reader.\n\nSophia's marriage to Tolstoy gave her the opportunity to put her abilities as a good reader to use，often advising him on his work throughout the writing process. She served as her husband's copyist，writing out multiple copies of his novels by hand. She made suggestions for and edits to his work，many of which were incorporated into the final product. In addition，she served as his manager，publicist，and agent，keeping track of the financial and legal sides of her husband's writing career. If Sophia were alive today，she might have found her calling at a publishing house or literary­agency.\n\nShe wrote her own Russian­language grammar textbook and translated texts from German and English. She also wrote fiction，including a revision of Leo's novella The Kreutzer Sonata. In that story，a man recounts the dramatic breakdown of his marriage；Sophia retold the narrative from his wife's point of view. The famous writer was impressed by his wife's literary talents.“What force of truth and simplicity！” he wrote in his diary upon reading one of her stories.\n\nHowever，Sophia never sought publication for her own work. Writing was not a fantasy that she look seriously；rather，she regarded it with “a certain contempt (轻蔑) and irony.” Limited by personal modesty，her domestic duties，and the expectations for women in her lifetime，Sophia never even considered seeking fame of her own. Yet Tolstoy would never have been able to produce the work he did without Sophia's vital contributions.\n\n",
  "f43ab108": "Space tourism is the term used to describe space travel for recreational or leisure purposes. What was once only a dream，as described in A Space Odyssey by Arthur C．Clarke，is now becoming a reality.\n\nFuturologists attempt to make predictions of what life will be like in the future. After the first man landed on the moon，they thought that hotels would be built on the moon by the year 2000. They also considered the possibility that，in the 21st century，families might go for a holiday on the moon. Neither of these predictions have come true yet—but the rapid development of technology may mean these predictions are possible in the years to come.\n\nSpace Adventures is currently the only company to have succeeded in sending paying passengers into space. It worked with the Federal Space Agency of Russia and Rocket and Space Corporation Energia to provide flights for the world's first private space explorers. Each paid over $20 million for their 10­day trip to the International Space Station.\n\nFollowing successful explorations into space，other companies are now considering the possibility of enabling tourists to visit space. To make it affordable，suborbital space travel is being considered by some companies，like Virgin Galactic. Passengers would be transported to a height of between 100 and 160 km above earth，experience 3－6 minutes of weightlessness and a view of the stars，then come back down to earth. This is expected to cost around $200,000 per person.\n\nWhile it could be an enriching experience，there are some disadvantages. Many critics say that a huge growth in the spaceflight industry could drastically speed up the process of global warming. The ozone layer would be damaged further and the polar regions would suffer. In addition，space travel is only really affordable for the super­rich，though Virgin Galactic claims to be “opening space to the rest of us”．\n\n\n\n1．What do you know about space tourism?\n\nA．It is nothing but a dream.\n\nB．It's only in some fairy tales.\n\n_C．It's a sightseeing tour in space.\n\nD．It's a scientific expedition.\n\n\n\n2．What is paragraph 2 mainly about?\n\nA．The future life on the moon.\n\nB．Landing on the moon in 1969.\n\n_C．Predictions about trips to the moon.\n\nD．The history of the moon exploration.\n\n\n\n3．Why is suborbital space travel considered possible?\n\n_A．It's cheaper.　　　　\tB．It's safer.\n\nC．It's greener. \tD．It's convenient.\n\n\n\n4．What is some critics' major concern about space tourism?\n\nA．Its safety.\n\n_B．Environmental effect.\n\nC．Social equality.\n\nD．Its expense.\n",

However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.\nThe hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.\n",

Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At the time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments. Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.\nFour days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.\n",

Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned form abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.\n'Have you anything to declare?' he asked, looking me in the eye.\n'No', I answered confidently.\n'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?'\n'Not at all,' I answered.\nThe Officer went through the case with great care. All the thing I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.\n'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically. 'You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'\n'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's hair gel.' Then I added with a smile, 'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'\nAs I expected, he did not believe me.\n'Try it!' I said encouragingly.\nThe officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth.

If the money was not paid promptly, the gangsters would quickly put a man out of business by destroying his shop. Obtaining 'protection money' is not a modern crime. As long ago as the fourteenth century, an Englishman, Sir John Hawkwood, made the remarkable discovery that people would rather pay large sums of money than have their life work destroyed by gangsters.\nSix hundred years ago, Sir Johan Hawkwood arrived in Italy with a band of soldiers and settled near Florence. He soon made a name for himself and came to be known to the Italians as Giovanni Acuto. Whenever the Italian city-states were at war with each other, Hawkwood used to hire his soldiers to princes who were willing to pay the high price he demanded. In times of peace, when business was bad, Hawkwood and his men would march into a city-state and, after burning down a few farms, would offer to go away protection money was paid to them. Hawkwood made large sums of money in this way. In spite of this, the Italians regarded him as a sort of hero.

For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.\nMy nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty. Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there. I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it. Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble. On his way to the sweet shop, he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain. George took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed is right arm through the drain cover. He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could no get his arm out.

The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.\nWhen Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened. Dimitri at once set out to find the thief. He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village. After telling several of his friends about the theft, Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb. Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb. He told him he had better return it or he would call the police. Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard. It was true that he had just bought a lamb, he explained, but his lamb was black. Ashamed of having acted so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him. While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.

He described it as 'a very agreeable situation located within two small hills in the midst of which flowed a great river.' Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal, for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.\nThe Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island. It has a span of 4,260 feet. The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer. Two great towers support four huge cables. The towers are built on immense underwater platforms make of steel and concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These alone took sixteen months to build. Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire. It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity. However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge. Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.\n",

Some so-called 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.\nIn spite of this, some people -- including myself -- were surprise by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture. The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said: 'Do not touch the exhibits. Some of them are dangerous!' The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture. Oddly shaped forms that are suspended form the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody. These objects, however, were different. Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres. The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time. In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights. These lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad. Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily. It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment.

However, boxing was very crude, for these were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.\nOne of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764. The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860, when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules. Though he was technically a prizefighter, Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport, for he brought science to the game. In this day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity. He was adored by rich and poor alike.\nMendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old. This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most eminent boxer in England. He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn. In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him. The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only be settled by a fight. A match was held at Stilton, where both men fought for an hour. The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated. Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time. It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England.

In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner. Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance, he always insisted that it should be written out in full.\nOne night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart. The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell. Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his bands. He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat. But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual. It was simply a blank sheet of paper. The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines. The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds. Then, squinting his eyes, he said: 'The light is dim. Read the letter to me'. And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler. Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either, the gaoler replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire, I must get my glasses.' With this, he hurried off the stage.

The Cutty Sark was one the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built. The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae. Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England. This race, which went on for exactly four exactly four months, was the last of its kind. It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.\nThe first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae, but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took lead. It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home, but during the race she had a lot of bad luck. In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away. The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her. A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty. This greatly reduced the speed of the ship, for there was a danger that if she traveled too quickly, this rudder would be torn away as well. Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead. After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted, but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead. Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win. She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae.

Much as we may pride ourselves on our good taste, we are no longer free to choose the things we want, for advertising exerts a subtle influence on us. In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product, advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.\nAdvertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to get something for nothing. An advertisement which begins with the magic word FREE can rarely go wrong. These days, advertisers not only offer free samples, but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well.

They offered to pay $10 a pound for the biggest biscuit baked by a listener. The response to this competition was tremendous. Before long, biscuits of all shapes and sizes began arriving at the factory. One lady brought in a biscuit on a wheelbarrow. It weighed nearly 500 pounds. A little later, a man came along with a biscuit which occupied the whole boot of his car. All the biscuits that were sent were carefully weighed. The largest was 713 pounds.

In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort. Though it may be possible to measure the value of material good in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us. There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives, yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service. The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. Everyone has something to sell.\nTramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule. Beggars almost sell themselves as human being to arouse the pity of passers-by. But real tramps are not beggars. They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others. In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity. A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him. He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences. He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but his is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people. His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease. By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do. He may hunt, beg, or stead occasionally to keep himself alive; he may even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom. We often speak of my even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom.

Many people find this sort of joke distasteful The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to judge for yourself.\nA man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas. From the moment he arrived there, he kept on pestering his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home. He dreaded having to spend Christmas in hospital. Though the doctors did his best, the patient's recovery was slow. On Christmas Day, the man still had his right leg in plaster. He spent a miserable day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing. The following day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good. The good. The man took heart and, sure enough, on New Years' Eve he was able to hobble along to a party. To compensate for his unpleasant experiences in hospital, the man drank a little more than was good for him. In the process, he enjoyed himself thoroughly and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals. He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.\n",
  "nce33": "Some time ago, and interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses -- often three storeys high -- were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.\nThe temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.\n",
  "nce330": "For years, villagers believed that Endley Farm was hunted. The farm was owned by two brothers, Joe and Bob Cox. They employed a few farmhands, but no one was willing to work there long. Every time a worker gave up his job, he told the same story. Farm labourers said that they always woke up to find that work had been done overnight. Hay had been cut and cowsheds had been cleaned. A farm worker, who stayed up all night claimed to have seen a figure cutting corn in the moonlight. In time, it became an accepted fact the Cox brothers employed a conscientious ghost that did most of their work for them.\nNo one suspected that there might be someone else on the farm who had never been seen. This was indeed the case. A short time ago, villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of Endley had died. Everyone went to the funeral, for the 'ghost' was none other than Eric Cox, a third brother who was supposed to have died as a young man. After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over fifty years.\nEric had been the eldest son of the family, very much older than his two brothers. He had been obliged to join the army during the Second World War. As he hated army life, he decided to desert his regiment. When he learnt that he would be sent abroad, he returned to the farm and his father hid him until the end of the war. Fearing the authorities, Eric remained in hiding after the war as well. His father told everybody that Eric had been killed in action. The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob. They did not even tell their wives. When their father died, they thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding. All these years, Eric had lived as a recluse. He used to sleep during the day and work at night, quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley. When he died, however, his brothers found it impossible to keep the secret any longer.\n",
  "nce331": "True eccentrics never deliberately set out to draw attention to themselves. They disregard social conventions without being conscious that they are doing anything extraordinary. This invariably wins them the love and respect of others, for they add colour to the dull routine of everyday life.\nUp to the time of his death, Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town. He was a shrewd and wealthy businessman, but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life. He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.\nDickie disliked snobs intensely. Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, preferring always to go on foot. Even when it was raining heavily, he refused to carry an umbrella. One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower. He wanted to buy a $300 watch for his wife, but he was in such a bedraggled condition than an assistant refused to serve him. Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag. As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter. The assistant asked him to leave, but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager. Recognizing who the customer was, the manager was most apologetic and reprimanded the assistant severely. When Dickie was given the watch, the presented the assistant with the cloth bag. It contained $300 in pennies. He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left -- 30,000 pennies in all! On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings. This exhibition received a great deal of attention in the press, for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists, they had in fact been painted by Dickie. It took him four years to stage this elaborate joke simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.\n",
  "nce332": "The salvage operation had been a complete failure. The small ship, Elkor, which had been searching the Barents Sea for weeks, was on its way home. A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain instructing him to give up the search. The captain knew that another attempt would be made later, for the sunken ship he was trying to find had been carrying a precious cargo of gold bullion.\nDespite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more. The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets and there was tremendous excitement on board went a chest was raised from the bottom. Though the crew were at first under the impression that the lost ship had been found, the contents of the chest proved them wrong. What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before.\nThe chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding. There were books, clothing and photographs, together with letters which the seaman had once received from his wife. The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to salvage as much as possible from the wreck. Nothing of value was found, but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest. From a heavy gun that was raised, the captain realized that the ship must have been a cruiser. In another chest, which contained the belongings of a ship's officer, there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943. The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen. The most valuable find of all was the ship's log book, parts of which it was still possible to read. From this the captain was able to piece together all the information that had come to light. The Karen had been sailing in a convoy to Russia when she was torpedoed by an enemy submarine. This was later confirmed by naval official at the Ministry of Defiance after the Elkor had returned home. All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.\n",
  "nce333": "We have all experienced days when everything goes wrong. A day may begin well enough, but suddenly everything seems to get out of control. What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions. Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.\nThings can go wrong on a big scale, as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney. During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue. The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car. This made the driver following her brake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake. As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying through the air, a lorry driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and on to the road. This led to yet another angry argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again. In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles. Only two stray dogs benefited from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake. It was just one of those days!\n",
  "nce334": "Antique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people. The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding place. But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop. There is always hope that in its labyrinth of musty, dark, disordered rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of assorted junk that little the floors.\nNo one discovers a rarity by chance. A truly dedicated bargain hunter must have patience, and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it. To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer. Like a scientist bent on making a discovery, he must cherish the hope that one day he will be amply rewarded.\nMy old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person. He has often described to me how he picked up a masterpiece for a mere $50. One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood. As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to interest him. The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor. The morning passed rapidly and Frank just come in, but that he could not be bothered to open it. Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open. The contents were disappointing. Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger, the box was full of crockery, much of it broken. Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box an suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom of the packing case. As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it. Glancing at it briefly, the dealer told him that it was worth $50. Frank could hardly conceal his excitement, for he knew that he had made a real discovery. The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece by Correggio and was worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n",
  "nce335": "The word justice is usually associated with courts of law. We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt. Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law. Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it. Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.\nThere are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept. Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference. At such times, justice acts like a living force. When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.\nWhen a thief was caught on the premises of large jewellery store on morning, the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right.' The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys. Towards midday, a girl heard a muffed cry coming from behind on of the walls. As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade. The cry had certainly come form one of the chimneys, but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was. They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries. After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney. As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move, but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall. The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney. He had been there for nearly ten hours. Justice had been done even before the man was handed over to the police.\n",
  "nce336": "We are less credulous than we used to be. In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences -- most of them wildly improbable. Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maidservant was really the hero's mother. A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time and wickedly plotting to bring about the hero's downfall. And so on. Modern readers would find such naive solution totally unacceptable. Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.\nWhen I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stooped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz poured scorn on the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busssman fully acquainted with this story, she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother. When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. After having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit. The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants. Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid, Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.\n",
  "nce337": "We have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual. After years of conditioning, most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables. Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather, but trains must be on time. Only an exceptionally heavy snowfall might temporarily dislocate railway services. It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong. The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.\nAfter consulting my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven. It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted mere hour and seventeen minutes. When I boarded the train, I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well. At the time, this did not strike me as odd. I reflected that there must be a great many local people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service. Neither was I surprise when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line. Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals. But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder, It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour, but barely chugging along at thirty. One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance. I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it. I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived. Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven. When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable. There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white. Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again. A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page. It said: 'This service has been suspended.'\n",
  "nce338": "Future historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times. They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates. What is more, they will not have to rely solely on the written word. Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMS are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have. They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action. But the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task. He has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues available. Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light on the history of early man.\nUp to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture, for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons. Recent scientific evidence seems to indicate that this assumption is incorrect.\nHistorians have long been puzzled by dots, lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls, bones, and the ivory tusks of mammoths. The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age which began about 35,000 B.C. and ended about 10,000 B.C. By correlating markings made in various parts of the world, historians have been able to read this difficult code. They have found that it is connected with the passage of days and the phases of the moon. It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar. It has long been known that the hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression. They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing. It is possible that there is a definite relation between these paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them. It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed.\n",
  "nce339": "The rough across the plain soon became so bad that we tried to get Bruce to drive back to the village we had come from. Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed. Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away. It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties. He simply had no sense of danger at all. No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.\nAs we bumped over eh dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders. The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car. We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine. Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.\nWhat a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared, giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps of bushes. But there was worse to come. Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure. In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped. Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car. We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty years and was tow feet wide and four feet deep. Even this had no effect. Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course. Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again. Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away. Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across. Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding half. A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!\n",
  "nce34": "These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices. People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.\nWhen he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret. Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.\n",

Inviting the fire brigade to put out a nonexistent fire is a crude form of deception which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in. Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims.\nWhen a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university, he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill. As soon as he had hung up, he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away, they were not take him seriously. He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people. Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information.\nThe student did in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on. Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away. When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen. He threatened to remove them by force. The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help. Shortly afterwards, four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen. As the men refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill. The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper. He threatened to call the police. At this, the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest. Pretending to speak seriously, one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station. Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him to a pay phone. Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.\n",
  "nce341": "The quiet life of the country ahs never appealed to me. City born and city bred. I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasional visit during the weekend. Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of hem has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months. Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life. He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gentle pace of living. Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture. My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV -- virtually the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.\nIf you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They invariably lie nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment. Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning. As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home. The cit dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry. Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me who city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.\n",
  "nce342": "Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber. They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.\nExploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations. It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave. Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer. The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet. This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks. The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps. As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable. The cave might never have been discovered has not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger. Since its discovery, it has become a sort of potholers' Everest. Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.\nA team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger. After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to narrow corridor. They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools. Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits. At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water. In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites -- some of them over forty feet high -- rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow. In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.\n",
  "nce343": "Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything. Insuring public or private property is a standard practice in most countries in the world. If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather. Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay. It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for cost of salvaging a sunken ship. But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.\nAdmittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip. Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own. Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.\nThe pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish. Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish. They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem. The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it. Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation. The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water. The men were now obliged to try once more. This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains. The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal. The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. Several minutes later, the dish was again put into operation and one of the water. Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. There was danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.\n",
  "nce344": "People travelling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land, sea, or air. Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours. Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy. It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey. Reading is only a partial solution, for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep. During the day, sleep comes in snatches. At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper, you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling, or fumbling to find you ticket for inspection. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic. By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food -- always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm. If it is not, and you are likely to get seasick, no form of transport could be worse. Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of travlling by sea.\nAeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated by them. They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport. But nothing can match them for speed and comfort. Travelling at a height of 30,000 feet, far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience. You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly. For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight. The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available, there is plenty to keep you occupied. An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world. You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. You really see the shape of the land. If the landscape is hidden from view, you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles before you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky. The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled. You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey.\n",
  "nce345": "In democratic countries any efforts to restrict the freedom of the press are rightly condemned. However, this freedom can easily be abused. Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political events. Though we may enjoy reading about the lives of others, it is extremely doubtful whether we would equally enjoy reading about ourselves. Acting on the contention that facts are sacred, reporters can cause untold suffering to individuals by publishing details about their private lives. Newspapers exert such tremendous influence that they can not only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people but can even overthrow a government.\nThe story of a poor family that acquired fame and fortune overnight, dramatically illustrates the power of the press. The family lived in Aberdeen, a small town of 23,000 inhabitants in South Dakota. As the parents had five children, life was a perpetual struggle against poverty. They were expecting their sixth child and were faced with even more pressing economic problems. If they had only had one more child, the fact would have passed unnoticed. They would have continued to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity. But they suddenly became the parents of quintuplets, an aeroplane arrived in Aberdeen bringing sixty reporters and photographers.\nThe rise to fame was swift. Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the country. Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to publish stories and photographs. Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but room baby food and soap manufacturers who wished to advertise their products. The old farmhouse the family lived in was to be replaced by new $500,000 home. Reporters kept pressing for interviews so lawyers had to be employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press conferences. While the five babies were babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in hospital nursery, their parents were paying the price for fame. It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. They had become the victims of commercialization, for their names had acquired a market value. Instead of being five new family members, these children had immediately become a commodity.\n",
  "nce346": "So great is our passion for doing things for ourselves, that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labour. No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for these are countless do-it-yourself publications. Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes. Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying out their own gardens; building garages and making furniture. Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers. Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.\nSome wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything. Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics. When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some woman assume that their husbands will somehow put things right. The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. It is a question of pride as much as anything else.\nLast spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawn mower. It had broken down the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it. I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself. One Saturday afternoon, I hauled the machine into the garden and had a close look at it. As far as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as good as new. Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple. The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it. The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once made up a lawn mower. But I was extremely pleased with myself. I had traced the cause of the trouble. One of links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped. After buying a new chain I was faced with the insurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together again. I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had reassembled it, for the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not seem to fit anywhere. I gave up in despair. The weeks passed and the grass grew. When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow. Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle. Buried somewhere in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.\n",
  "nce347": "The river which forms the eastern boundary of our farm has always played an important part in our lives. Without it we could not make a living. There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the houses, so we have to pump from the river for farm use. We tell river all our secrets. We know instinctively, just as beekeepers with their bees, that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it.\nWe have special river birthday parties in the summer. Sometimes were go upstream to a favourite backwater, sometimes we have our party at the boathouse, which a predecessor of ours at the farm built in the meadow hard by the deepest pool for swimming and diving. In a heat wave we choose a midnight birthday party and that is the most exciting of all. We welcome the seasons by the riverside, crowning the youngest girl with flowers in the spring, holding a summer festival on Midsummer Eve, giving thanks for the harvest in the autumn, and throwing a holy wreath into the current in the winter.\nAfter a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks. This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom guest to extremes. We are lucky in that only the lower fields, which make up a very small proportion of our farm, are effected by flooding, but other farms are less favorably sited, and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners.\nOne had winter we watched the river creep up the lower meadows. All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little. We were, however, worried about our nearest neighbors, whose farm was low lying and who were newcomers to the district. As the floods had put the telephone out of order, we could not find out how they were managing. From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours, and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point. The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down. Next came a horse, swimming bravely, but we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted. Suddenly a raft appeared, looking rather like Noah's ark, carrying the whole family, a few hens, the dogs, cat, and bird in a cage. We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood, for their house, which had sound foundations, would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged. The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadows with boathooks, in the hope of being able to grapple a corner of the raft and pull it out of the current towards our bank. We still think it a miracle that they we able to do so.\n",
  "nce348": "In this much-travelled world, there are still thousands of places which are inaccessible to tourists. We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable. But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers. Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.\nWe had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity. These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town. This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside. Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees. We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. In it there was a boatman fast asleep. We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side. Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.\nThe path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby. Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. When we later walked down the main street of the villager, we were followed by a silent procession of children. The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. Faces appeared at windows. Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways. The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard. There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. We needed no further warning. Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.\n",
  "nce349": "It is a good thing my aunt Harriet died years ago. If she were alive today she would not be able to air her views on her favourite topic of conversation: domestic servants. Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework. She had a huge, rambling country house called 'The Gables'. She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband's death. Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entertain lavishly. I often visited The Gables when I was boy. No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate. The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass cabinets; even my uncle's huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust. Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished. She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names. Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy, in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please. While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.\nBessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years. During that time she so gained my aunt's confidence that she was put in charge of the domestic staff. Aunt Harriet could not find words to praise Bessie's industriousness and efficiency. In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook. She acted the role of the perfect servant for three years before Aunt Harriet discovered her 'little weakness'. After being absent from the Gables for a week, my aunt unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner. No only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily. She bumped into the furniture and kept mumbling about the guests. When she came in with the last course -- a huge pudding -- she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force. Though this caused great mirth among the guests, Aunt Harriet was horrified. She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk. The guests had, of course, realized this from the moment Bessie opened the door for them and, long before the final catastrophe, had had a difficult time trying to conceal their amusement. The poor girl was dismissed instantly. After her departure, Aunt Harriet discovered that there were piles of empty wine bottles of all shapes and sizes neatly stacked in what had once been Bessie's wardrobe. They had mysteriously found their way there from the wine cellar!",
  "nce35": "Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their readers with unimportant facts and statistics. Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refused to publish it. The article began: 'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace'. The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.\nThe journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but the took a long time to send them. Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.\n",
  "nce350": "The New Year is a time for resolutions. Mentally, at least, most of us could compile formidable lists of 'dos' and 'don'ts'. The same old favorites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't' like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercise every morning and to read more of an evening. An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.\nThe daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable. Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out. After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. It was this that betrayed me. The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. However, my enthusiasm waned. The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished. Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home formwork Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to book. One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading. In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!\n",
  "nce351": "Predicting the future is notoriously difficult. Who could have imagined, in the mid 1970s, for example, that by the end of the 20th century, computers would be as common in people's homes as TV sets? In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government departments, and large organizations. These were the so-called mainframe machines. Mainframe computers were very large indeed, often occupying whole air-conditioned rooms, employing full-time technicians and run on specially-written software. Though these large machines still exist, many of their functions have been taken over by small powerful personal computers, commonly known as PCs.\nIn 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA. It can properly be described as the first 'home computer' and it pointed the way to the future. This was followed, at the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple. In the early 1980s, the computer giant, IBM produced the world's first Personal Computer. This ran on an 'operating system' called DOS, produced by a then small company named Microsoft. The IBM Personal Computer was widely copied. From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user-friendly home computers and multimedia machines which are in common use today.\nConsidering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today. Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days. Bagrit foresaw a time when computers would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work. All these computer uses have become commonplace. Of course, Leon Bagrit could not possibly have foreseen the development of the Internet, the worldwide system that enables us to communicate instantly with anyone in any part of the world by using computers linked to telephone networks. Nor could he have foreseen how we could use the Internet to obtain information on every known subject, so we can read it on a screen in our homes and even print it as well if we want to. Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper. This is what makes Leon Bagrit's predictions particularly remarkable. If he, or someone like him, were alive today, he might be able to tell us what to expect in the next fifty years.\n",
  "nce352": "My cousin, Harry, keeps a large curiously-shaped bottle on permanent display in his study. Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green, an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, grayish substance. If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud. If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin. This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have. The bottle really does contain perfumed mud. How Harry came into the possession of this outlandish stuff makes an interesting story which he is fond of relating. Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years.\nHarry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist. He would invent fanciful names on the spot. On entering a shop, he would ask for a new perfume called 'Scented Shadow' or for 'insoluble bath cubes'. If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out. He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did. How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me.\nHarry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud. One day, he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for 'Myrolite', the shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable. When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite' was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles. This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf. She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements. When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him. Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud. He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment. However, it was his turn to be surprised, for the woman's eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect. For once, Harry had to admit defeat. He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price. He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm. From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive. The curious bottle, which now adorns the bookcase in his study, was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.\n",
  "nce353": "The Scandinavian countries are much admired all over the world for their enlightened social policies. Sweden has evolved an excellent system for protecting the individual citizen from highhanded or incompetent public officers. The system has worked so well, that it has been adopted in other countries too.\nThe Swedes were the first to recognize that public official like civil servants, police officers, health inspectors or tax-collectors can make mistakes or act over-zealously in the belief that they are serving the public. As long ago as 1809, the Swedish Parliament introduced a scheme to safeguard the interest of the individual. A parliamentary committee representing all political parties appoints a person who is suitably qualified to investigate private grievances against the State. The official title of the person is 'Justiteombudsman', but the Swedes commonly refer to him as the 'J.O.' or 'Ombudsman'. The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure. He investigates complaints large and small that come to him from all levels of society. As complaints must be made in writing, the Ombudsman receives an average of 1,200 letters a year. He has eight lawyer assistants to help him and examines every single letter in detail. There is nothing secretive about the Ombudsman's work for his correspondence is open to public inspection. If a citizen's complaint is justified, the Ombudsman will act on his behalf. The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint. He may gently reprimand an official or even suggest to parliament that a law the altered. The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman's work.\nA foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been ill-treated by the police, simply because he was a foreigner. The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case. There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner's complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation. It was impossible for the Ombudsman to take action, but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village, he immediately sent one of his layers to investigate the matter. The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt roughly with foreigners on several occasions. The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be recorded in the official files. It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts. The policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if any further complaints were lodged against him, he would prosecuted. The Ombudsman's prompt action at once put an end to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed.\n",
  "nce354": "We have been brought up to fear insects. We regard them as unnecessary creatures that do more harm than good. We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat ageist our lighted windows. We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless one like moths. Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. No matter how much we like honey, or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence. Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle?\nLast summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree. The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. I am especially proud of it, not only because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. During the summer, I noticed tat the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. Clusters of tin insects called aphids were to be found on the underside of the leaves. They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them. I immediately embarked on an experiment which, even though if failed to get rid of the ants, kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours. I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids. The tape was so stick that they did not dare to cross it. For a long time. I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it. I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route. They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree. I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!\n",
  "nce355": "Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our won Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and old not emit light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our won solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.\nWhether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. Imagine a star up t twenty times larger, brighter, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we find such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century.\nIt is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles iron solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'. The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope is always in the realms of science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it.'\n",
  "nce357": "I stopped to let the car cool off and to study the map. I had expected to be near my objective by now, but everything still seemed alien to me. I was only five when my father had taken me abroad, and that we eighteen years ago. When my mother had died after a tragic accident, he did not quickly recover from the shock and loneliness. Everything around him was full of her presence, continually reopening the wound. So he decided to emigrate. In the new country he became absorbed in making a new life for the two of us, so that he gradually ceased to grieve. He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman's care; but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me. He always meant to go back on day, but not to stay. His roots and mine bad become too firmly embedded in the new land. But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother's grave. He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and, when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own.\nI hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps, which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage. It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone, after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory. Well, I had been wrong, for I was now lost.\nI looked at the map and then at the millimeter. I had come ten miles since leaving the town, and at this point, according to my father, I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance. I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages and no church spire -- only a lake. I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere. So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map. I landed up at the same corner. The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map. I left as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams. And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me. Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback, riding in my direction. I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village. He said that there was now no village. I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name. This time he pointed to the lake. The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too. The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir.\n",
  "nce358": "The old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived. Her shopping had tired her and her basket ad grown heavier with every step of the way home. In the life her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest; but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks, She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence. Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the porter from his basement. By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police. Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for nay intruders who might still be lurking in her flat.\nThey went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints. The chaos was inconceivable. She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding; and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over. At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her. Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat. The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony. There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers. So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars' first job that day and they must have been disturbed. The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights. The old lady though the was a fussy creature, but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.\n",
  "nce359": "People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.\nSome things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste. Among these I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites. Collecting small items can easily become a mania. I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money. As she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote; but she is never sufficiently strong-minded to be able to stop the practice. It is a harmless bait, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction.\nCollecting as a serous hobby is quite different and has many advantages. It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy. One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home. Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books. This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it. There are also other benefits. One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find. So one's circle of friends grows. Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country. Over the years, one may well become a authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences. In this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to take about it. Collecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.\n",
  "nce36": "The expensive shops in a famous arcade near Piccadilly were just opening. At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty. Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.\nThe silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.\n",
  "nce360": "Punctuality is a necessary habit in all public affairs in civilized society. Without it, nothing could ever be brought to a conclusion; everything would be in state of chaos. Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. The intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. But people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, so they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. If no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tires, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. They are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. Some friends of my family had this irritating habit. The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. Then they arrived just when we wanted them.\nIf you are citing a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minted too late. Although being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one; and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. Such an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was traveling alone.\nShe entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, since her parents had impressed upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her. She gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket. To her horror he said that she was two hours too soon. She felt inhere handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down al the details of the journey and gave it to the porter. He agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop, but only to take on mail, not passengers. The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake. The porter went to fetch one and arrive back with the station master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station; this little 'o' indicated that the train only stopped for mail. Just as that moment the train came into the station. The girl, tears streaming down her face, begged to be allowed to slip into the guard's van. But the station master was adamant: rules could not be broken and she had to watch that train disappear towards her destination while she was left behind.\n\n\n",
  "nce37": "Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't despair when they made mistakes like this (and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!\nA recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had very good day and put his wallet containing £3,000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé's wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilated Ladies! They examined the remains and John got all his money back. 'So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back,' said a spokeswoman for the Bank. 'Last year, we paid £1.5m on 21,000 claims.'\nDamaged bank notes. The Queen's head appears on English bank notes, and 'lady' refers to this.\n",
  "nce38": "The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2,473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe. The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. Now that a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.\nDuring the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to -30° and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer of they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.\n",
  "nce39": "Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence. Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.\nRecently the New York Animal Medical Center made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings. There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth. 'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers.' a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.\n",

  "rjbgz0305c11e": "—-THE LAND OF THE LONG WHITE CLOUD\nDue to its remote location in the Pacific Ocean, New Zealand was one of the last countries to be discovered by humans. Although the majority of the current population is of European descent, it was the ethnic minority group known as the Maori who were the first to settle there. They named the country “Aotearoa”—the “Land of the Long White Cloud”. Today, both past and present Maori culture can be found all over the country for all welcomed visitors to appreciate.\nMaori arts and crafts are world-renowned and very popular with tourists. The Waka is a traditional canoe that has been skillfully carved out of a tree trunk, with beautiful carvings added to show tribal history and culture. A large war canoe could be up to 40 metres long and hold up to 80 people. Visitors to Maori historic buildings, such as tribal meeting halls, can see beautifully carved wooden architecture. In addition, there are countless smaller objects and masks that were made to honour ancestors or legends, or to preserve a story for future generations.\nAnother well-known part of Maori culture is the traditional kapa haka dance—made famous by New Zealandʼs national rugby union team, who often perform it before games. The kapa haka is a traditional dance performed for celebrations, special guests, and battle ceremonies. The performance includes different dances and songs that make up a whole. A common dance sequence could be waiata tira (warm-up song), whakaeke (entrance song), waiata- ā-ringa (action song), haka (challenge), pou (old-style singing), poi (ball-swinging), and whakawātea (closing song).\nTraditional tattoos, known as “moko”, are also a strong visual part of Maori culture. They are most often done in spiral forms across a man’s face, and on the chin and lips of a woman. They represent a person’s status, and are also believed to increase attractiveness. Receiving moko is seen as a great honour, and it is often part of a ritual to signal a person has passed an important milestone. As such, it is usually added in stages as a person grows older and achieves more, in a sense telling a unique story of a person’s life.\nThere is so much more for visitors to discover about Maori culture. It is an essential part of what makes New Zealand the modern country that it is: a multicultural country that is forever evolving in new and interesting ways.",
  "rjbgz03121a4c": "The Chinese Spring Festival is regarded as the most significant festival of the year among the Chinese. It lasts for 15 days but Chinese people also consider the days of preparation beforehand as an important part of the Spring Festival.\nThere are a number of things people usually do before the Chinese Spring Festival. One of these is cleaning the house for the Lunar New Year. Dust makes people think of old or outdated things. Therefore, sweeping dust out of the house is a way of saying goodbye to old things and welcoming new things. Another important custom for families is to decorate their doors with red couplets. The phrases on the couplets express hopes for a prosperous new year. In the southern part of China, people will buy fresh flowers or orange trees to decorate their homes. The most important custom of the Chinese Spring Festival is the big family dinner on the eve of the Lunar New Year. This is usually a big reunion of grandparents, parents, and children. It reflects how important family is to Chinese people around the world. That is why millions of Chinese people travel long distances to get home before the eve of the Lunar New Year. Also, families typically eat certain types of lucky food at the family reunion dinner. Eating fish, for example, is supposed to bring more wealth and prosperity than one needs, as the pronunciation of “fish” in Chinese (yu) is also used for “surplus”.\nWhen the New Year comes, there are many interesting festival activities. Adults give children “lucky money” in red envelopes. People greet family and friends with “Xinnian Hao” or “Gongxi Facai” whenever they may meet. Another part of this custom of sharing good wishes is to pay visits to relatives and bring them gifts. Commonly exchanged gifts include food such as fruit, sticky rice cakes, and homemade desserts. In addition, friends and family go out to enjoy loud and colourful fireworks, spend time at temple fairs, and watch exciting dragon and lion dances.\nThe Chinese Spring Festival symbolises a farewell to the old year and a warm welcome to the brand new year. More importantly, it is a special occasion to return home and gratefully reunite with family members. This deeply rooted tradition has been an integral part of Chinese culture for a very long time, and will continue to live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people.",
  "rjbgz031e6d59": "Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant\nWhen I was growing up in Havre, my family was very poor. My father worked long hours to support our family. We ate the same food every day, saved where we could, and tried our best to keep up appearances. Every Sunday, we would put on our best clothes and go for a walk by the sea. My parents would walk at the back with great dignity. My sisters, both of marriageable age, would stride ahead, hoping to attract the right people. On those days, when we saw the ships returning from distant countries, my father would remark: “What a surprise it would be if Jules were on that one! Eh?”\nMy uncle Jules was the black sheep of the family. He had squandered both his inheritance and my father’s, before setting forth for America. There, he set up a business in New York and wrote to say that he would soon repay my father. The news caused a dramatic change. Once regarded as a hopeless case by all, Uncle Jules was now considered a good and honest man, like all the other Davranches.“When I am wealthy, I shall return to Havre,” he promised in another letter. “I hope it won’t be too long and that we shall all live happily together.”That letter was pulled out and read at every opportunity. The more time passed, the more hopeful my family became. After all, our dreams were built on the wealth of Uncle Jules.\nA few years later, one of my sisters got married to a clerk—a man whom I suspect to have seen the letter—and my family celebrated by going on a rare holiday together. On the ship bound for Jersey, we saw an old man shucking oysters for the passengers.\n“That man looks extraordinarily like Jules,” my father muttered to my mother.\nAstonished, my mother went to take a closer look. She, too, turned pale as a sheet. My father then asked the captain for more information.\nThe captain said, “He’s a tramp whom I met in America. He’s avoiding his family in Havre because he owes them money. I think his name is Jules—Jules Darmanche or Darvanche, or something like that.”\n“It’s he! What should we do?” moaned my father.\nMy mother, suddenly furious, exclaimed, “I knew that thief would remain useless! What else can we expect from a Davranche!”\nOnly the three of us were in the know. Determined to keep it that way, my parents handed me five francs and asked me to pay for the oysters discreetly.\n“How much do we owe you, monsieur?” I asked.\n“Two francs fifty,” he replied.\nI handed him the money and received change from his poor wrinkled hand. I looked at his old and unhappy face, and I, too, saw my uncle. Unable to help myself, I gave him back fifty centimes.\n“Thank you so much, young sir!” he said gratefully, without recognising me.\n“Are you insane?” my mother exclaimed when I returned with two francs. “Giving a tip to that man-—”\nMy father pointed at his son-in-law. Everyone fell silent. As we drew closer to Jersey, I wanted desperately to see my Uncle Jules again and to console him with tender words, but he had long disappeared below the deck.",
  "rjbgz031e6f20": "(adapted from the story of the same name by Kent Nerburn)\nTwenty years ago, I drove a taxi. One time, I was called at midnight to pick someone up. When I arrived, the building was completely dark except for one light in a window.\nI walked to the door and knocked. After a long wait, the door opened. A small woman in her 80s stood before me. By her side was a small suitcase.\n“Would you carry my bag out to the car?” she said. I took her suitcase and gave her my arm. We walked slowly to the street. She kept thanking me for my kindness.\n“It’s nothing,” I told her. “I try to treat my passengers how I want my mother treated.”\n“You’re such a good boy,” she said. When we got in the taxi, she gave me an address. Then she asked, “Could you drive through the downtown?”\n“It’s not the shortest way,” I answered.\n“I don’t mind,” she said. “I’m in no hurry. I’m on my way to a hospice.”\nI saw her eyes shining with tears.\n“I don’t have any family left,” she continued. “The doctor says I don’t have very long.”\nI quietly turned off the meter. “What road do you want me to take?” I asked.\nFor hours, we drove through the city. She showed me the building where she had once worked. We drove through the neighbourhood where she and her husband had lived. Sometimes she asked me to just slow down while she sat staring into the darkness, saying nothing.\nAs the sun was coming up, she suddenly said, “I’m tired. Let’s go now.”\nWe drove in silence to the hospice. As we pulled up, two nurses were waiting for us. They helped her into a wheelchair.\n“How much do I owe you?” she asked me, reaching for her purse.\n“Nothing,” I said. Without thinking, I leaned down and gave her a hug. She hugged me tightly.\n“You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,” she said. “Thank you.”\nI squeezed her hand and then walked back to my taxi. For the rest of that day, I could hardly talk.\nI believe I have never done anything more important in my life. We usually think that our lives are defined by great moments. But I now realise that great moments catch us by surprise, because they often seem quite small.",
  "rjbgz031e7acc": "ACT 2, SCENE 3\nN = Narrator H = Henry P = Portia R = Roderick O = Oliver\n\nN: Henry and Portia fell in love. Henry also met an old family friend who had money troubles. His friend used Henry’s name to get people to invest in his gold mine. This made Henry rich. A month has passed.\nKnowing the two brothers were back, Henry dressed himself in the finest clothes and went to see them with Portia.\n(At the brothers’ home, the servant lets them in. The two brothers are seated, waiting.)\nH: Good morning, gentlemen. (Roderick seems very surprised to see Portia.)Portia, these are the men who helped me.\nP: So very nice to meet you, kind sirs. (She gives Oliver a wink.)\nH: Gentlemen, I’m ready to report.\nR: Er ... Portia, I ...\nO: Now we can decide the result of the bet which Roderick and I made. If you’ve won for me, you shall have any job as my gift. Have you got the million-pound bank note?\nH: Here it is, sir.\nO: I’ve won! Now what do you say, Roderick?\nR: I say that I’ve lost twenty thousand pounds. Why, that is amazing, man!\nH: Come, let’s be going now, Portia.\nO: But wait, wait! The job, you know. I ought to give you a job, as I promised.\nH: Well, thank you very much, but I really don’t want one now.\n\n\nP: Henry, I’m disappointed in you. You didn’t thank the gentlemen properly. May I do it for you?\nH: Let me see you try.\n(Portia walks over to Roderick and gives him a hug. Then she sits in Oliver’s lap, puts her arms around his neck and kisses him on the cheek. Oliver begins laughing.)\nP: Papa, he says he doesn’t want anything else from you.\nH: (surprised) My dear, is that your papa?!\nP: He’s my stepfather.\nH: Oh, my dearest dear sir, I apologise for what I said. You have got a job opening that I want.\nO: Name it.\nH: Son-in-law.\nO: Well, well, well! But you’ve never had such a job before. How can I be sure you can do it successfully?\nH: Try me ... oh, do, I beg of you!\nO: Oh, well, all right.\nN: Were Portia and Henry happy? Words alone were not enough to describe it. Eventually, Portia’s stepfather took that bank note back to the Bank of England and cashed it. The bank note was then useless for money but was his wedding gift to the young couple. Yes, the bank note was worth a million pounds, but it was not worth even one tenth of what Henry felt for Portia.\n",
  "rjbgz032b19eb": "## What is the Big Bang Theory?\nThe Big Bang Theory is an idea about how our universe began. Many scientists believe that everything in the universe used to be tightly pressed together. Then this mass of high energy separated into smaller pieces very quickly about 14 billion years ago to create the universe. At the moment of creation, the universe was extremely hot and everything was very close together. Then it began to spread out and cool. Today, the universe is still getting bigger. The Big Bang is considered to be the beginning of everything: time, space, and all the matter in the universe.\n## What is the Hubble Space Telescope?\nThe Hubble Space Telescope is a very powerful telescope and was put into low orbit around Earth in 1990. Its four main instruments use a 2.4-metre mirror to look deep into space. The telescope does not have to deal with the effects of background light like telescopes on Earth, so it has been able to take very detailed pictures of space. A big achievement of the telescope has been to help scientists correctly measure how quickly the universe is expanding.\n## What is FAST?\nChina’s Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope is better known as FAST. Located in Guizhou Province in southwestern China, FAST has been used since 25 September 2016. Its 500-metre dish is the world’s largest single-dish radio telescope. As such, scientists can use it to look for various things in the universe that are very far away. They can also use it to search for signs of communication that are not coming from Earth. Finding such things would prove that there is intelligent life somewhere else in the universe!\n## What is a quantum satellite?\nOn 16 August 2016, China became the first country in the world to launch a quantum communications satellite into space. A quantum satellite is different from other satellites because it links together very small things, called subatomic particles, and uses them to send and receive information. Unlike other information, this information is completely safe from people who may want to steal it. If anyone tries, the link between the subatomic particles changes and the information becomes unreadable.",
  "rjbgz03315801": "Each country has its own unique culture, often represented by symbols, such as foods, sports, music, and clothes, which tell us something about it. When you think of America, what symbols come to your mind first?\nPerhaps one of the most famous symbols of the US is fast food. Fast-food restaurants became popular when people began driving cars around the country. Many of the earliest fast-food restaurants were drive-ins where people ate in their cars while they were parked. However, now drive-throughs have become popular because people need to keep up with the speed of modern life. With a drive-through, you can just drive up to a window, pick up the food, and then drive away. About 20% of all American meals are eaten in the car, and Americans spend about 10% of their income on fast food. No wonder America is called the “Fast-Food Nation”!\nWhen it comes to seeing a game in person, baseball is by far the most popular sport in America. In a typical year, more people attend baseball games than football and basketball games combined. And for most people, baseball is “America’s game” in a way that football and basketball are not, because it is a special symbol of the American spirit. For one thing, while baseball is a team sport, every player can be a hero or star. For another, almost anyone can play baseball, even if you do not have great skills or ability. Finally, there is nothing more American than eating a hot dog while watching a baseball game on a hot summer afternoon. Baseball still is the “national pastime”.\nJazz is often called “America’s music”. It is a music style completely created in the United States by African American musicians. Jazz music broke through the colour barriers, and has become a key part of American culture. One early jazz pioneer was the trumpet player Louis Armstrong (1901–1971). Perhaps more than any other person, Armstrong helped spread jazz beyond its home in New Orleans to the rest of the United States, and to the world. Jazz musicians freely make up their own music to express their own feelings, even while playing in a group. This freedom and individuality make jazz a popular symbol of America.\nThere are many other symbols of America, such as the Statue of Liberty, Hollywood, and Broadway. These are but a few symbols that show something of American culture.",

Outside, the temperature is -32°C. Snow covers the streets and is piled up along the sidewalks. The music and the lights of the Quebec Winter Carnival continue, but after a whole day of watching parades, riding in horse carriages, and listening to music, the touristsʼ feet are freezing and their noses are red.\nEvery year, hundreds of thousands of people come to Quebec to take part in the week-long winter festival. Everyone who comes must be prepared to keep moving, as it is too cold to stand and watch for long.\nEarly in the morning, you can watch the snowboarding competition on the hill overlooking the river. Competitors speed down the track and through the air as though they could fly.\nThe more brave of heart may try the canoe races. Five or six men paddle each canoe across the partly-frozen St Lawrence River. The river is full of big chunks of ice, and if you were to fall in, you would freeze to death in under two minutes.\nOne of the favourite events is the dog-sled race, in which teams of about six husky dogs pull long sleds at great speeds along a snowy track. One person drives the sled, shouting to the dogs to encourage them. The sound of the dogs barking, the calls of the drivers, and the shouts of the crowd create an exciting northern experience. The dogs are strong and beautiful animals with thick fur, and many have blue eyes.\nWhile admiring the ice sculptures everywhere in the city, much like those in Harbin in China, you can stop off with other tourists in an igloo for hot tea or coffee. It is amazing how warm these ice houses can be!\nLater in the evening, you can join the crowd at the Ice Palace, where Bonhomme the snowman is king. You can dance outside to the music of a band, whose members are all dressed in heavy clothes—even some of their instruments are dressed up for winter.\nFinally, you will probably want to sit down in a cafe to warm up and plan for the next day.

  "rjbgz03ba8a76": "Some of the world’s most important scientists think the idea of people living on Mars will come true one day. Stephen Hawking believed humans must move into space to survive. “Once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe,” he said. Robert Zubrin, a rocket scientist, agrees and thinks starting with Mars makes the most sense. He thinks sending people to Mars will allow us to learn a lot—for example, about the ability of humans to live in a very different environment.\nHowever, scientists will need to terraform Mars for people to be able to live. Terraforming means changing the environment on a planet so that it is similar to Earth’s. One of the main goals of terraforming Mars is to warm it up because the average temperature there is about -60°C. One idea for warming Mars is to build factories there that produce greenhouse gases. This could take many centuries. However, it should lead to rainfall and the growth of plants, resulting in more air that people can breathe.\nAnother big concern for scientists is whether humans can move to Mars and still stay healthy in mind and body. As a test, six people lived in a Mars-like environment in Hawaii for a year before “returning to Earth” recently. It was a 1,200-square-foot room that was on the side of a volcano and used the sun for energy. Christiane Heinicke, one of the people who lived there, said that one of the biggest issues was feeling bored. So humans on Mars would always need to keep themselves busy with various activities. Another important finding was that the people living together should all be able to get along and work together.\nOne particular organisation based in Europe is planning to send the first humans to Mars before 2030. The organisation believes that its project is giving people worldwide the chance to be part of the first human crew ever to live on Mars for good. However, many experts think the project’s cost of US$6 billion is too low for it to be successful. The American space agency NASA believes that sending people to Mars would cost about US$100 billion, although this estimate is based on bringing them back to Earth, too. Regardless, it seems that humans living on Mars may well happen a lot sooner than most people believe.",

You know that place in James Hilton’s Lost Horizon . Well, now I can safely say that I’ve been there!\nBefore you get too excited, I must admit that this Shangri-La is the name of a city in Yunnan, China, and not the place in the book! I decided to come here because I wanted to experience the real Shangri-La for myself, even if it’s different from the paradise we read about. So far, I really like it here.\nOn Monday, I left Lhasa at noon, and after changing flights once, I reached Shangri-La—also called “Zhongdian”—at eight in the evening. The airport is not far from the city, so my taxi ride to the hotel was very short. That night, I was so exhausted that I had a quick bite to eat and then crashed.\nYesterday, I went to the Potatso National Park. The park covers such a wide area that the admission ticket for the park includes a bus tour, as it is the only way to see all the major sites in one day. Just to give you an idea of how large the place is, imagine a park that spans across vast forests, wetlands, lakes, meadows, and several villages! On the bus, I made friends with the passengers around me, and they said that I had definitely picked the right season to visit the park. The autumn scenery, they said, would be absolutely picture- perfect.\nOn top of its beautiful scenery, the park is also famous for its rich biological diversity. Did you know that Potatso makes up less than one percent of China’s total land area, but it contains more than 20 percent of the country’s plant and animal species? The black-necked cranes were my favourites. I saw two of them at the picturesque Bita Lake!\nAt Shudu Lake, the first stop on the bus tour, we saw horses, cows, and yaks enjoying the sunlight and eating grass contentedly. As a nature lover like me, I’m sure you can imagine how delighted I was by this sight.\nBita Lake, however, is absolutely my favourite place in Potatso. Just imagine, a beautiful lake, blue skies, majestic mountains, and golden trees all around me. In such tranquil surroundings, I could easily believe myself to be standing in James Hilton’s Shangri- La. For those who live in cities like we do, spending time in nature can be an incredibly rejuvenating experience.\nTomorrow, I am going hiking at the Tiger Leaping Gorge. Fingers crossed that there will be good weather! Anyway, I need to get some sleep now since tomorrow’s going to be a long day, but I’ll tell you all about it when I get back!\nLove,\nChris",
  "rjbgz110d1e03": "Chemical pesticides and artificial fertilisers have been in widespread use in farming since the middle of the 20th century. When they were first introduced, many farmers welcomed them as a great way to fight crop disease and increase production. Over time, however, what some scientists have found is that their long-term use can sometimes harm both the land and people’s health.\nFor example, pesticides can damage the land by killing not only harmful bacteria and insects, but also helpful ones. In addition, these chemicals can stay in the soil and underground water sources for a long time. This affects the crops grown on the land and, in turn, the animals and humans who digest them. Many people worry that these chemicals may make them ill and even cause cancer. In fact, some pesticides like DDT have been prohibited in most countries because of the damage they cause to people and the environment. As for chemical fertilisers, crops grown with them usually grow too fast to be rich in nutrition. They may look beautiful on the outside, but inside there is usually more water than essential minerals, and they often have less flavour as well.\nAs an alternative, some farmers have switched to organic farming, and many customers have turned to organic food when they shop at the local grocery. Organic farming is simply farming without using any chemicals. Organic farmers focus on keeping their soil rich and free of disease through natural means. For example, many organic farmers use natural waste from animals as fertiliser. This makes the soil in their fields richer in minerals. It also keeps the air, soil, water, and crops free of chemicals.\nOrganic farmers also use many other methods to produce rich soil. They often change the kind of crop grown in each field every year. For instance, they may grow corn or wheat in a field one year, and then grow beans there the next. Why different crops are grown is because they put important minerals back into the ground, making it ready for the next batch of crops. Organic farmers also plant diverse crops that use different depths of soil to help keep it rich. For example, peanuts grow on the ground’s surface, but many other vegetables put down deep roots. The goal of using different organic farming methods is to grow good food while avoiding damage to the environment or to people’s health.\nSome people would prefer to stop the use of man-made chemicals in agriculture entirely. What keeps them from doing so is the fact that chemical farming serves the high demand for food around the world. Organic farming is nowhere near able to meet that need. Therefore, there is still a long way to find a suitable solution that puts sufficient food on the dinner table while keeping people and the environment as healthy as possible.",
  "rjbgz1115d7e1": "We use both words and body language to express our thoughts and opinions in our interactions with other people. We can learn a lot about what people are thinking by watching their body language. Words are important, but the way people stand, hold their arms, and move their hands can also give us information about their feelings.\nJust like spoken language, body language varies from culture to culture. The crucial thing is using body language in a way that is appropriate to the culture you are in. For example, making eye contact—looking into someone’s eyes—in some countries is a way to display interest. In other countries, by contrast, eye contact is not always approved of. For example, in many Middle Eastern countries, men and women are not socially permitted to make eye contact. In Japan, it may demonstrate respect to look down when talking to an older person.\nThe gesture for “OK” has different meanings in different cultures. In Japan, someone who witnesses another person employing the gesture might think it means money. In France, a person encountering an identical gesture may interpret it as meaning zero. However, you should avoid making this gesture in Brazil and Germany, as it is not considered polite.\nEven the gestures we use for “yes” and “no” differ around the world. In many countries, shaking one’s head means “no”, and nodding means “yes”. By comparison, in Bulgaria and southern Albania, the gestures have the opposite meaning. There are also differences in how we touch each other, how close we stand to someone we are talking to, and how we act when we meet or part. In countries like France and Russia, people may kiss their friends on the cheek when they meet. Elsewhere, people favour shaking hands, bowing from the waist, or nodding the head when they meet someone else.\nSome gestures seem to have the same meaning everywhere. Placing your hands together and resting them on the side of your head while closing your eyes means “sleep”. A good way of saying “I am full” is moving your hand in circles over your stomach after a meal.\nSome body language has many different uses. Perhaps the best example is smiling. A smile can help us get through difficult situations and find friends in a world of strangers. A smile can break down barriers. We can use a smile to apologise, to greet someone, to ask for help, or to start a conversation. Experts suggest smiling at yourself in the mirror to make yourself feel happier and stronger. And if we are feeling down or lonely, there is nothing better than seeing the smiling face of a good friend.",

  "rjbgz1131f160": "Have you ever forgotten to lock the door of your house? Or, have you ever forgotten to switch off the TV or computer? These kinds of things happen to us all the time, waste resources, and can sometimes lead to problems. However, in the not-too-distant future, we will be living in smart homes that will lock the door for us when we are away and remember to switch off the TV when we forget. These smart homes will keep us secure, save us energy, and provide a more comfortable environment to live in.\n## Intelligent Controls\nToday, we have to use switches for our lights, knobs for our appliances, and remote controls for our TVs and air conditioners. In the future, we will be using advanced technology every day for automatic control of just about everything in our home. The future home will use integrated sensors to tell when you leave home each morning, and then go into an energy-efficient mode all by itself. You will no longer have to think about turning switches on and off yourself. Your home will also learn your daily routine and preferences, so everything will be ready for you when you get home each evening. Your lights will come on the instant you enter the door along with your favourite music or TV programmes, and you will find your dinner already prepared for you. All controls will respond to voice commands, so if you want to change your routine, you just say aloud what you want and the home system will obey.\n## Regular Health Checks\nIn addition, your smart home will be monitoring your health for you every day.\nYour bed, for example, will record how well you sleep every night. It will also be checking your body weight. If you start to have sleep or weight problems, it will send a warning to your phone. It will also give you suggestions on a healthier diet and how to sleep better. Smart toilets will be keeping constant track of your health as well. They can warn you early on if there is something abnormal or if you have a critical illness, such as cancer, and potentially save your life.\n## No More Disasters\nSmart homes will be able to prevent serious damage from accidents. For example, if a water pipe starts leaking, or if there is a short in the electrical wiring, your smart home will detect it and provide you with the relevant information. This way, you will be able to fix the problem before your home becomes flooded or catches fire.\nThis smart technology is not a fantasy. Many of these new innovations are already available and being used in some homes. In this sense, the home of tomorrow is already the home of today. Nevertheless, it will take some years before most new homes begin to use this new technology.",
  "rjbgz114807f1": "Human beings are not the only ones who communicate. Animals use body language to tell each other how they feel and what they think. Here is a quick look at how some of our animal friends send messages to us and to each other.\nDogs use sounds, body movements, and their tails to communicate. When a dog is happy, its ears will stand up and its eyes will be wide open. The dog will start barking, moving its tail, and running around in circles or jumping up and down to show you that it wants to play. A dog that is afraid will lie on its back and close its eyes. The dog may show its teeth and lower its body so that it is close to the ground. The dog may also shake, and it will put its tail between its legs. When a dog is angry, its main body language is showing its teeth and growling. The dog will try making itself look as big as possible. The tail will stand straight out from the body.\nElephants also use noises and body language to express themselves. An elephant’s sense of smell is highly developed. An elephant can smell how another elephant is feeling and even tell if it is sick. The elephant’s nose, or trunk, is also used to make noises and to welcome other elephants. Different noises have a variety of meanings: they can mean “I am hungry”, “I am angry”, or “Good to see you!” An elephant’s body language includes ear signals and gestures. If an elephant spreads its ears, it means “Watch out!” To show friendship, elephants will touch each other with their trunks and stand close to each other, putting their heads together.\nDolphins are social animals. They live in groups and love showing each other their feelings. An angry dolphin will sometimes hit its tail on the surface of the water. The movement and noise let other dolphins know that something is wrong. If a dolphin wants to send a message over a long distance, or if it wants to show how strong it is, it will jump high out of the water and land on its side, making a loud noise. A dolphin’s favourite activity is leaping into the air while playing with its friends. When dolphins are tired and need to rest, they will swim in small groups close to the surface. If you see dolphins doing this, you should not disturb them.",
  "rjbgz1148ed17": "While city life may be exciting, all of us need to escape into nature now and again. Some of the best family holidays involve things like picnics, camping, hikes, and forest walks. Exploring nature allows us to catch sight of rare animals and come across special places of beauty. Of course, none of this would be possible without protected nature areas. This is why national parks are so important. They are places to be treasured—places where the country locks away the very best it has to offer for everyone to enjoy. To protect this heritage, governments allow very little development inside most national parks. A few national parks allow things like hotels and recreation areas to be constructed within them, but most parks do not allow any development at all. Visitors have to bring in their own food and drink, and then be sure to carry out all their waste when they leave.\n\n---\n\nThe very first national park is also one of the most famous in the world—Yellowstone, in the western USA. Nineteenth-century explorers were amazed by what they saw in Yellowstone. Apart from the beautiful mountains, rushing rivers, and tall waterfalls, there were geysers, which sent boiling water as high as 91 metres into the air. Then there were the hot springs, as colourful as rainbows. These explorers wanted to protect the natural features of the area from development so that future generations could enjoy the area. And so, in 1872, Yellowstone was established as a national park. Today, around four million people a year visit it. Many come hoping to see wildlife, which is no longer as common in the American West as it once was. Everyone comes to see the geysers, especially Old Faithful, which sits near the centre of the park, and sends 95.6°C water up to 56 metres into the air every 44 to 125 minutes.\nWhile Yellowstone was made a national park in order to protect its natural features, many others were set up to protect wildlife. A good example is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. In the local African language, “Serengeti” means “the place where the land runs on forever”. It is a wide plain covered in tall grass, and dotted with trees. When foreigners began killing the Serengeti lions for sport, the government decided to take action, eventually turning the area into a national park in 1951. Even then, it was a challenge to protect the park’s wildlife. In 1959, a film was made of the great wildebeest migration which occurs every year in the park. This film, Serengeti Shall Not Die, helped people around the world understand the need for wildlife protection. Today, the Serengeti is one of the top tourist attractions in the world. Nowhere else can you see such great herds of wildebeests and zebras, in addition to lions, rhinoceroses, elephants, and many other rare creatures.\nNot all famous national parks are on land. Some national parks are marine parks. One good example of this is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia. Stretching over 2,300 kilometres, the Great Barrier Reef is considered one of the natural wonders of the world. It is the largest structure in the world made by living creatures. A wide variety of tropical wildlife also makes the reef its home. Since the Great Barrier Reef is just below the surface of the water, it is an excellent place to see nature, and millions of people travel there every year. The park was created in 1975 to protect the reef from overdevelopment and fishing. Unfortunately, the biggest danger to the Great Barrier Reef is something park management cannot stop—global warming. Rising ocean temperatures are causing some coral to die and the colourful reefs to turn grey. Hundreds of years ago, people could not imagine that there would ever be a time when forests would be cut down, oceans would become polluted, and wildlife would face extinction.\nFacing the problems of environment pollution and overdevelopment, some national parks have been set aside to protect both natural features and wildlife. A good example of this is the Sanjiangyuan National Park, which was set up in the south of China’s Qinghai Province in 2000. The park is at a very high altitude and contains the source of the Yangtze River (Changjiang), Lancang River, and Yellow River. It is also home to many species of plants and birds, along with animals like Tibetan antelopes, snow leopards, wolves, foxes, bears, yaks, and sheep. In most areas of the reserve, development is strictly forbidden, and any permitted development is closely monitored.\nThe protection of natural areas has attracted much media attention, and now more and more people are supporting the idea of eco-friendly development. Today, people understand that national parks are not just for one generation; they should be protected for every generation to come.",
  "rjbgz1152c449": "Yuan Longping, known as the “father of hybrid rice”, was one of China’s most famous scientists. Yet, he considered himself a farmer because he continually worked the land in his research. Indeed, his slim but strong body was just like that of millions of Chinese farmers, to whom he had devoted his life.\nYuan Longping was born in 1930 in Beijing. His parents wanted him to pursue a career in science or medicine. However, what concerned him most was that farmers often had poor harvests and sometimes even had a serious shortage of food to eat. To tackle this crisis, he chose to study agriculture and received an education at Southwest Agricultural College in Chongqing.\nAfter graduating in 1953, he worked as a researcher. Yuan Longping realised that larger fields were not the solution. Instead, farmers needed to boost yields in the fields they had. How this could be done was a challenging question at the time. Yuan was convinced that the answer could be found in the creation of hybrid rice. A hybrid is a cross between two or more varieties of a species. One characteristic of hybrids is that they usually attain a higher yield than conventional crops. However, whether it was possible to develop a hybrid of self-pollinating plants such as rice was a matter of great debate. The common assumption then was that it could not be done. Through intense effort, Yuan overcame enormous technical difficulties to develop the first hybrid rice that could be used for farming in 1974. This hybrid enabled farmers to expand their output greatly.\nToday, it is estimated that about 60 percent of domestic rice consumption in China is comprised of crops generated from Yuan’s hybrid strains, and his strains have allowed China’s farmers to produce around 200 million tons of rice per year. Yuan’s innovation has helped feed not just China, but many other countries that depend on rice as well, such as India and Vietnam. Because of his invaluable contributions, Yuan Longping received numerous awards both in China and abroad.\nGiven that Yuan’s hybrids made him quite wealthy, one might think he would have retired to a life of leisure. However, this is far from the case. Deep down, Yuan was still very much a farmer at heart. As a man of the soil, he cared little for celebrity or money. Instead, he made large donations to support agricultural research.\nWhat impressed people most about Yuan Longping was his ongoing ability to fulfil his dreams. Long ago, he envisioned rice plants as tall as sorghum, with each ear of rice as big as a broom, and each grain of rice as huge as a peanut. He succeeded in producing a kind of rice that could feed more people at home and abroad. His later vision for “seawater rice” also became a reality, and potentially opened up nearly one million square kilometres of salty land in China for rice production. Even in his later years, Yuan Longping was still young at heart and full of vision, and everyone was always excited to see what he would dream up next.",
  "rjbgz1156df9a": "When it was announced in 2018 that the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai had created the world’s first cloned monkeys, Zhongzhong and Huahua, heated discussions followed online. In fact, cloning has always been with us. It is a way of making an exact copy of another animal or plant. It happens in plants when gardeners take cuttings from growing plants to make new ones. It also happens in animals when identical twins are produced from the same egg. These are both examples of natural clones.\nCloning has two major uses. First, gardeners use it to produce large quantities of plants for sale. Second, it is valuable for research on new plant species and for medical research on animals. Cloning plants is fairly straightforward, while cloning animals is much more complicated and difficult. Over the years, many scientists failed in their attempts to clone animals, but their determination and patience paid off in 1996 with a breakthrough—the cloning of Dolly the sheep.\nThe sheep cloning procedure works like this: • Female sheep A provides an egg cell.\n• The nucleus is removed from the egg cell.\n• The egg cell is ready for a new nucleus.\n• Female sheep B provides a somatic cell for the clone. The nucleus of this cell contains all the genes needed to produce a new sheep.\n• The nucleus is taken out of the somatic cell.\n• The somatic cell nucleus from sheep B and the egg cell from sheep A are joined.\n• The cell divides and grows into an embryo.\n• The embryo is put into female sheep C, who becomes the carrier of the clone.\n• The lamb which is born is the clone of sheep B. It is in every way identical to sheep B, but younger.\nWith the advances of scientific research, cloning will have several major uses in the future. For one thing, it could be used to breed animal species which are endangered, or even bring back species which are now extinct. For another, it could be used to grow human organs or tissue in animals, which could be used for human organ transplants or medical treatments. Finally, cloning could be used to breed animals that will provide us with higher quality meat, milk, or eggs.\nWhile there are technical issues that need to be worked through to make widespread cloning possible, the biggest concerns are moral. For example, if scientists brought an extinct animal back into existence, it would probably end up living in a zoo. That is not very good for the animal. Even worse for the animal is using it as a source of organ transplants—-because it will be injured or even die. In addition, many people worry that eating animal products that result from cloning might be harmful to our health over time. The possibility of using cloning to produce human beings is an even bigger concern. What would happen if such knowledge ended up in the wrong hands?\nWhen it comes to cloning, we wonder, ultimately, whether cloning will help or harm the world. No doubt, we will be talking about this question for a long time to come.",
  "rjbgz11570a2c": "Albert Einstein, who is perhaps the greatest scientist in modern physics, is often considered one of the smartest men who ever lived. He made numerous contributions to the world, the most well-known being the general theory of relativity and the famous formula E=mc². Einstein was not only a genius; he was a courageous and kind figure loved by many people.\n\nThis gentle genius was born in Germany on 14 March 1879. When he was 16, he tried to enter university in Switzerland, but failed due to his low scores in the general part of the entrance exam, despite obtaining exceptional scores in maths and physics. After studying for another year, he managed to pass the exam, entering university in 1896 and graduating in 1900.\n\nAfter two years of looking for work as a teacher, Einstein took a job as a clerk in the Swiss patent office. While working there, out of a strong passion for knowledge, he continued to study, earning a doctorate in physics in 1905. That same year, which was later recorded as a miracle year in science, he published four extraordinary physics papers. Following this, he gradually became famous throughout the world as the new Isaac Newton. After four years, he was able to quit his job at the patent office and enter research full-time at a university. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.\n\nCircumstances changed in 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, who was Jewish, found the doors of academic institutions closed to him. As a consequence, he had to flee Germany. After spending time in Europe, he finally took up a position as a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, USA. Following that, he continued to make great achievements in physics and mathematics.\n\nTo the public, he was seen as a slightly odd-looking but kind and funny man. He had a thick moustache and long white hair, which sometimes stood on end as though he had just received an electric shock. Although he was a genius, he sometimes forgot things, like his friends’ birthdays. But despite his peculiarities, he was loved by his friends and neighbours. There is even a story about how he helped a little girl who knocked on his door and asked for help with her homework. In fact, Einstein often encountered people on the street who would stop him and ask him to help explain things. After many such occasions, he finally started saying, “Pardon me! Sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein!”\n\nOn 18 April 1955, it was reported that Einstein had passed away, and the whole world mourned the great loss of a brilliant scientist.",
  "rjbgz115e0ac2": "Agriculture has come a long way from its ancient beginnings. Long ago, farmers would work hard on their individual plots of land, using simple tools or even their bare hands. They tended to their crops for many hours each day so that the crops grew well and did not suffer from pests or disease. Luck played a great part in farming. For example, a single storm could destroy a whole year’s work, while a summer of good weather could ensure a good harvest. Where farms were located was often critical to success, too. In hilly countries, some lucky farmers would have land in the lowlands—full of deep, rich soil, while other unlucky farmers would have land on the hills with hard soil full of stones. In addition, some areas would simply be too dry or too wet to grow much of value.\nModern science and technology have helped to greatly reduce the back-breaking labour involved in farming, along with the reliance on luck and guesswork. These advances have enabled people in various countries to benefit from exceptional innovations in crop production.\nProbably one of the most beneficial innovations is drip irrigation, which has made it possible to develop big, green farms in the middle of the desert. While there have been experiments in different places in the past to make drip irrigation a reality, it is in the Middle Eastern country of Israel that drip irrigation has become a modern success.\nHow Simcha Blass, a scientist, discovered this new way of irrigation is rather interesting. He was visiting a friend in the Israeli desert in the 1930s when he noticed something unusual. There was a row of trees near his friend’s house, and one of them was much taller than the others. When Blass dug around the roots to find out what the secret was, he discovered that the house’s water pipe had a small leak at the base of the tree. The pipe’s steady drip onto the tree’s roots was giving it just enough water at the perfect rate to grow strong and quickly.\nThrough this discovery, farmers can now produce crops on arid land without needing much water. This irrigation method uses far less water than other methods. The limited and focused use of just the right amount of water also denies moisture to weeds and pests, keeping them from harming the crops.\nDrip irrigation deals with a lack of water in an area. However, what if an area has plenty of water, but little usable soil? As it turns out, it is possible to grow plants without using soil at all. With hydroponics, plant roots are supported by rocks, glass beads, or a fibre mat. Nutrient-rich water is then provided so that the plants can grow. Given that China has many areas where soil conditions are poor, Chinese researchers have been experimenting with hydroponics since the 1970s. Recent research has centred on vertical hydroponics farming. With a vertical farm, the crops are planted in trays that are stacked into plant skyscrapers. Furthermore, nearly all hydroponic farms and vertical farms are either partially or fully automated.\nBesides drip irrigation and hydroponics, scientists have made impressive innovations in agricultural machinery. Of course, the most important and useful agricultural machines, such as tractors and harvesters, were invented long ago. However, many such machines are now self-driving. They use cameras and a positioning system to see where they are and where they are going, and their routes can be planned by a computer. Depending upon the crop, some farms hundreds or thousands of hectares in size can be managed by just a handful of workers using machines such as these. For fruit cultivation, robots are now being employed in some countries. For instance, in Japan, robots are used to spray individual grape clusters with insecticide, trim them so they are all of equal size, bag them so that they can be further protected from pests and the elements, and then harvest them when they are ripe. In other countries, robots are being used to harvest oranges and strawberries, plant rice, and spray pesticides. The field of agricultural robotics is still in its infancy, so there is still a need for human labour to harvest many crops. To help ease this burden, there are also robots that can help workers carry fruit and vegetables to storage areas.\nWith such technological advances, the image of a farmer pushing a plough will eventually become a thing of the past. Farmers of the future are more likely to be technicians working in control rooms, surrounded by computers and monitors. Indeed, some farmers already are.",
  "rjbgz115f2073": "As an educator, people often ask me how I know what is going on in the minds of my students. Many students are quite shy and don’t speak all that much. At the same time, in a classroom of more than forty students, it is hard to have many one-on-one conversations with each person. So, how can I really know what makes each student tick?\nMy answer? I look at their body language.\nIt is easy to recognise when students are interested in a lesson. Most tend to look up and make eye contact. When I make a joke, they smile. When I talk about something difficult, they look confused. I know when students are really interested, however, because they lean forward and look at me. People have a tendency to lean towards whatever they are interested in. So if a student has his head lowered to look at his watch, it implies he is bored and just counting the minutes for the class to end. If two friends are leaning their heads together, they are probably writing notes to each other. Of course, not everyone who looks up is paying attention in class.\nSome students look up, but there is an absence of eye contact. Their eyes barely move, and they always have the same distant expression on their faces. It is as though they are asleep with their eyes open.\nSome students are amused by something else. They spend all their time looking anywhere but at me. Then again, some students’ favourite activity is daydreaming. With their chins on their hands, they occupy themselves by staring out of the window or up at the ceiling. They are certainly interested in something, but who knows what. The main thing is reminding distracted students that they need to pay attention in class.\nWhile it is easy to perceive when students are interested, bored, or distracted, it is sometimes much harder to distinguish when students are troubled. Students who are angry, afraid, or experiencing anxiety may have their arms crossed in front of their chests and their legs closed or crossed, like they are guarding their bodies. Students who are sad or worried will nearly always wear a frown. They may also hide their faces in their hands like they are embarrassed or ashamed. Some students act this way merely because they are afraid of being called on by the teacher. However, if a student does not bother to brush her hair and her eyes are red from weeping, then I can infer that there are deeper issues at work. It could be that she is having serious conflicts with other students or at home. Whatever it is, I know I need to inquire and assess what is going on.\nUltimately, my duty is helping every student to learn. Their body language lets me know when to adjust class activities, when to intervene, and when to talk to students individually, so they can all get the most out of school. Reacting to body language is an important component of being a teacher.",
  "rjbgz1175bee8": "## A Summer Where the Sun Never Sleeps\nI wake up to the sound of the wind buffeting the cloth of my tent. Even though the sun is brightly shining, telling whether it is morning or night is impossible. Iʼm above the Arctic Circle, where in summer the sun never sets. Checking my watch, I see that it is 7:30 a.m. I leave my tent and walk over to the mountain edge. Spreading out before me, branches of the Rapa River flow through the valley below. I’m in the remote far north of Sweden in Sarek National Park, a place with no roads or towns.\n## A Land of Mountains and Ice\nSarek’s mountains used to be covered by vast sheets of ice. Around 9,000 years ago, this ice melted, leaving behind about 100 glaciers. Soon after, reindeer began to arrive. Following the reindeer were the Sami people, who made this territory their home. Getting here is quite difficult, so apart from the Sami very few people have ever seen Sarek. In 1909, Sarek was made a national park in order to keep the land in its natural state. Though the Sami are allowed to continue their traditional way of life in the park, no one else can live here, and all new development is banned within park boundaries. At the far side of the valley, an ancient Sami cottage is visible. Close by, there are a few reindeer feeding on grass.\n## Man at Peace with Nature\nFor hundreds of years, looking after reindeer was a way of life for the Sami. They used the reindeer’s meat for food, their bones for tools, and their skin for making clothes and tents. Since reindeer were always on the move, the Sami would pick up their tents and accompany them. Today, most Sami have houses in villages near Sarek and live a modern life just like their neighbours. But every spring, a small number of Sami still follow their reindeer into the valleys of Sarek, living in tents or old cottages and enjoying their traditions. I am not a Sami, but in Sarek I’ve adopted some of their habits. For example, this morning my breakfast is flat bread warmed over a fire, dried reindeer meat, and some sweet and sour berries that I found growing near my tent.\n## A Land of Adventure\nAfter breakfast, I pack my bag and set out again. Since I must carry all of my food and supplies with me, my bag weighs about 30 kilograms. If today is anything like yesterday, it will be full of sweat and hard work as I hike over this difficult land to my destination on the other side of the valley. However, I cannot complain. Being in such a beautiful and wild place makes me feel blessed to be alive. Here I am, alone under this broad sky, breathing the fresh air, and enjoying this great adventure. What could be better?",
  "rjbgz11879340": "6 October 2015\n\nThis year’s Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Tu Youyou (co-winner), whose research led to the discovery of artemisinin, a crucial new treatment for malaria. Artemisinin has saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and has led to improved health for millions of people. Over 200 million people around the world get malaria each year, and about 600,000 die from it. Artemisinin has become a vital part of the treatment for malaria, and is thought to save 100,000 lives a year in Africa alone.\n\nTu Youyou, a committed and patient scientist, was born in Ningbo, China, on 30 December 1930, and graduated from Peking University Medical School in 1955. After she graduated, she worked at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing. In 1967, the Chinese government formed a team of scientists with the objective of discovering a new treatment for malaria, and Tu Youyou was among the first researchers chosen. In the beginning, Tu Youyou went to Hainan, where malaria was more common, to study malaria patients. In 1969, she became the head of the project in Beijing, and decided to review ancient Chinese medical texts to find traditional botanical treatments for the disease. Her team examined over 2,000 old medical texts, and evaluated 280,000 plants for their medical properties. From their research, they discovered and tested 380 distinct ancient Chinese medical treatments that showed promise in the fight against malaria.\n\nOne medical text from the fourth century suggested using the extract from sweet wormwood to treat a fever. Tu’s team tested a collection of dried wormwood leaves but found no effect. They then tried boiling fresh wormwood, and using the liquid obtained from this to treat malaria, but this did not work either. Their project got stuck. However, Tu Youyou would not acknowledge defeat. She analysed the medical texts again, and by chance, she found one sentence suggesting a different way to treat the wormwood. She concluded that boiling the sweet wormwood apparently destroyed its medical properties.\n\nUsing a lower temperature to draw out the extract, she found a substance that worked. After failing more than 190 times, the team finally succeeded in 1971. Tu Youyou and her team members even insisted on testing the medicine on themselves to make sure that it was safe. Later, the medicine was tested on malaria patients, most of whom recovered. This medicine, which was called artemisinin, soon became a standard treatment for malaria.\n\nAccording to Tu Youyou, the discovery of artemisinin was a team effort. Upon hearing that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize, she said, “The honour is not just mine. There is a team behind me, and all the people of my country. This success proves the great value of traditional Chinese medicine. It is indeed an honour for China’s scientific research and Chinese medicine to be spread around the world.”\n",
  "rjbgz11935d8a": "This morning, I saw the shocking headline: “Passenger Dies When Car Crashes in Driverless Mode”. In the article, various people said that the public should oppose the idea of developing driverless cars. They said that some advances in technology were unnecessary and could even be dangerous. Hence, we should cease accepting technology just because it is new. The newspaper reported that the car company had already apologised for the accident, but the families of the deceased said it was not enough. Nevertheless, the company still claimed that most people would be travelling in driverless cars one day soon.\nOn the one hand, there are many different groups of people around the world who live happily in the absence of new technology. Probably the most well-known are the Amish, a group of Christians living in rural America. They do not own or drive cars, watch TV, or use the Internet. They have lived mainly as farmers since the 18th century, and they will probably be living the same way in the distant future. They advocate a simple life with an emphasis on hard work, family, and community. They think that is better than caring about luxuries or following the lives of the rich and famous. It could even be argued that the Amish’s quality of life is better since they live in and appreciate the natural environment rather than living in large, polluted cities.\nOn the other hand, new technology has provided people everywhere with many benefits over the years. For example, the latest weather-tracking computer programmes give people lots of warnings about potential natural disasters, which saves many lives. Moreover, the Internet has made it possible for friends and family to keep in touch easily even if they are on opposite sides of the world. It has also made finding opportunities in life much easier, as it allows people to make larger networks of friends through using social media.\nPersonally, I have benefited quite a lot from technological advances. I found my career as an AI designer through a social media network. My health monitor, which I wear all the time, has also helped me get into the best shape of my life. Of course, when new technology changes the way we live, it can be a scary prospect. Nevertheless, I will always look on the positive side of change and accept it rather than resist it.",
  "rjbgz11c65261": "Adapted from Helen Keller’ work\nI have often thought it would be a blessing if each human being were stricken blind and deaf for a few days at some time during his early adult life. Darkness would make him more appreciative of sight; silence would teach him the joys of sound.\nNow and then I have tested my seeing friends to discover what they see. Recently I asked a friend, who had just returned from a long walk in the woods, what she had observed. “Nothing in particular,” she replied.\nHow was it possible, I asked myself, to walk for an hour through the woods and see nothing worthy of note? I who cannot see find hundreds of things to interest me through mere touch. I feel the delicate symmetry of a leaf. I pass my hands lovingly about the smooth skin of a silver birch, or the rough, shaggy bark of a pine. In spring I touch the branches of trees hopefully in search of a bud, the first sign of awakening Nature after her winter’s sleep. Occasionally, if I am very fortunate, I place my hand gently on a small tree and feel the happy quiver of a bird in full song.\nAt times my heart cries out with longing to see all these things. If I can get so much pleasure from mere touch, how much more beauty must be revealed by sight. And I have imagined what I should most like to see if I were given the use of my eyes, say for just three days.\nOn the first day, I should want to see the people whose kindness and companionship have made my life worth living. I do not know what it is to see into the heart of a friend through that “window of the soul”, the eye. I can only “see” through my fingertips the outline of a face. I can detect laughter, sorrow, and many other obvious emotions. I know my friends from the feel of their faces.\nFor instance, can you describe accurately the faces of five different friends? As an experiment, I have questioned husbands about the colour of their wives’ eyes, and often they express embarrassed confusion and admit that they do not know.\nI should like to see the books which have been read to me, and which have revealed to me the deepest channels of human life. In the afternoon I should take a long walk in the woods and intoxicate my eyes on the beauties of the world of Nature. And I should pray for the glory of a colourful sunset. That night, I should not be able to sleep.\nOn my second day, I should like to see the pageant of man’s progress, and I should go to the museums. I should try to probe into the soul of man through his art. The things I knew through touch I should now see. The evening of my second day I should spend at a theatre or at the movies.\nThe following morning, I should again greet the dawn, anxious to discover new delights, new revelations of beauty. Today, this third day, I shall spend in the workaday world, amid the haunts of men going about the business of life.\nAt midnight permanent night would close on me again. Only when darkness had again descended upon me should I realise how much I had left unseen.\nI am sure that if you faced the fate of blindness you would use your eyes as never before.\nEverything you saw would become dear to you. Your eyes would touch and embrace every object that came within your range of vision. Then, at least, you would really see, and a new world of beauty would open itself before you.\nI who am blind can give one hint to those who see: Use your eyes as if tomorrow you would be stricken blind. And the same method can be applied to the other senses. Hear the music of voices, the song of a bird, the mighty strains of an orchestra, as if you would be stricken deaf tomorrow. Touch each object as if tomorrow your tactile sense would fail. Smell the perfume of flowers, taste with relish each morsel, as if tomorrow you could never smell and taste again. Make the most of every sense; glory in all the facets of pleasure and beauty, which the world reveals to you through the several means of contact which Nature provides. But of all the senses, I am sure that sight must be the most delightful.",
  "rjbgz11e320ff": "In the 1960s and 1970s, some writers and university professors called themselves “futurists”. These futurists tried to predict the future. Only a few of their predictions were right, and all of them missed something that was just around the corner: the revolution in computers and information technology. The problem was that none of these futurists were scientists or engineers. So, while they knew the future would have more powerful computers, they had no clue what these computers would look like, what they could do, or what impact they would have on our lives.\nThis should make us hesitate before we try to predict the future. Having said that, we can make some good guesses about future technology by looking at current scientific and technological advances. We can also ask the real experts: the scientists and engineers who are bringing us these advances.\nAccording to experts, in the future computers will be so common that we may no longer even notice them. Forget smartphones and smart watches-—we will have smart clothes that adjust to the weather and our body temperature, and change size to fit our body shape. We will also have smart contact lenses. Using these smart contact lenses, we can access the information and power of computers in a way that far exceeds anything currently possible.\nBecause so much of our daily life will be integrated with computers, virtual reality will become an actual, real reality for many of us. Technology will not just allow us to see a world that is thousands of kilometres away—-or which only exists in a computer-—but will also allow us to touch and smell that world. This virtual world will at times seem as real as-—if not more real than-—the actual world around us. Without leaving home, you will be able to take tours of foreign countries, or even get a medical exam by a doctor in another city.\nSpeaking of medicine, through new technology, people who have brain or spinal injuries will be able to find new hope. There is already, for example, technology which will allow blind people to see using cameras and deaf people to hear using microphones that are connected to their brains. Future technology will allow people to overcome all sorts of physical disabilities.\nMuch research is being done to unlock the human mind. Using technology that is being developed now, people in the future may be able to not just read someone else’s mind, but also record their thoughts like one would record a movie. Some other research involves using robotic technology to replace human functions. For example, robot hands are being developed for people who have no hands. These artificial hands are connected to a person’s nerves so that the person’s brain tells the hands what to do. In the future they will work just as well as real human hands. Indeed, they may even be better. Not only can they be made stronger and faster than human hands, but also sturdier so they will not break or get injured as easily.\nAs a result of such advances, in the future, some people who are badly injured may become more robot than human. That is, their brains will control their robotic body parts so they can live their lives fully without being handicapped. Many new parts will be made to replace human body parts that break down, meaning it may be possible to use this technology to extend our lives long past the time of normal death by old age.\nThese are just a few of the things that are already being explored in science and technology. There will also be advances in transportation and space travel. Of course, there is a lot that we still do not know about the future. Science and technology may provide a road map for the future, but they cannot tell us what we will find along the way. But if we knew everything about the future, then where would the mystery and excitement be? We should all eagerly view the future as a great adventure-—a new world waiting to be explored. Who knows exactly what we will find?",
  "rjbgz11ebb34d": "While the dream of most university graduates is to start a successful career in a big city, more and more young people are choosing to stay in their own hometowns so they can stay with their family and friends. For some young people, it is also a matter of making the quality of life for other people in their hometowns better. They also have a desire to improve and maintain the natural and economic environments in these places for generations to come.\nLi Dan is a woman who has discovered that returning home to work in the field of agriculture could offer her both a meaningful challenge and a good standard of living. Born in a small village in Southwest China, she decided not to follow many of her former classmates to the city after getting her degree at university. Instead, she returned to her village and started her own fruit-growing business. Working hard over the last several years, and taking advantage of new technology and the Internet, she has expanded her business to include agritourism. Moreover, her company’s annual income has reached six million yuan and more than 50 new jobs have been created. As a result, her decision has also helped to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of many people in her village.\nWith China’s population expected to continue rising in the coming years, the government understands the importance of agriculture. It also understands that university graduates can help come up with better ways to grow crops, and develop new, creative ways of farming using modern technology. To help these young people with their bright and innovative ideas, the government is providing financial help. Business development loans are becoming easier for these young people to obtain, too. Government policies that aim to eliminate poverty are also having a beneficial effect.\n“Life in big cities is not all it’s cracked up to be,” said Zhang Tao, from Binchuan county in Yunnan Province, adding that the air was bad, transport was terrible, and it was hard to make a decent living. What life in one’s hometown offers is a strong support network. More importantly, this network is also a good one for getting new agribusinesses up and running quite quickly. Thus, it is no surprise that more new graduates are now attracted to life in the country, where they can fulfil personal goals and contribute to their local communities rather than just being white-collar professionals in big cities.",

  "rjbgz11f1221d": "Victor Hugo once said, “Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face.” Up to now, nobody has been able to create laughter like Charlie Chaplin. He brightened the lives of millions through two world wars and the hard years in between. He made people laugh at a time when they felt depressed, so they could forget their difficulties.\nNot that Charlie’s own life was easy. He was born to a poor family in 1889. His parents were both poor music hall performers. To make money, Charlie learnt to sing as soon as he could speak, and dance as soon as he could walk. Such training was common in stage families at that time. Every member of the family performed to help make money. Then his father died, and so Charlie spent his youth looking after his sick mother and his brother. By his teens, Charlie had, through his humour, become one of the most popular child actors in England. No one was bored watching him—he made everything funny.\nAs time went by, Chaplin began making silent films, where the story was told only through body language and gestures. Usually, Chaplin appeared in these films as the Little Tramp, a poor man with a moustache, large trousers, worn-out shoes, and a small, round hat. He walked around stiffly, carrying a walking stick. Even though the Little Tramp was considered a failure in life, he was still full of kindness and hope. Like Chaplin, the Little Tramp always tried to turn his sadness into joy. Chaplin once said, “My pain may be the reason for somebody’s laugh. But my laugh must never be the reason for somebody’s pain.” He also said, “To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with it!”\nIn 1914 and 1915, Chaplin worked almost constantly, making nearly 50 short films. Though short films were in high demand, Chaplin’s popularity allowed him to take more time and make longer films. One of these films, The Kid (1921), is considered to be among the greatest films ever made. In the film, the Little Tramp finds a baby that has been abandoned, and raises the child as his own. While the film has many funny moments, it also has times of great sadness. As Chaplin said, it was “a picture with a smile, and perhaps a tear”.\nHow did the Little Tramp make a sad situation funny? Here is an example from one of his most famous films, The Gold Rush (1925). It is around 1900, and gold has just been discovered in Alaska. The Little Tramp has rushed there in search of gold, but without success. Instead, he is hiding in a small house on a mountain during a snowstorm, with nothing to eat. He is so hungry that he has cooked one of his boots for dinner. The Little Tramp first cuts off the laces and eats them as if they were noodles. Then he cuts up the boot and shares it with Big Jim, another fortune-hunter. The Little Tramp chews on the lower part of the boot, treating it like something good to eat and making you believe that this is one of the best meals he has ever tasted.\nWhen the silent era ended in 1929, Chaplin continued to make films, but these films had little or no dialogue. They had just music and sound effects. Unfortunately, his style of visual humour had gone out of style and so his films were not as successful as before. Finally, in 1940, Chaplin gave up silent films to make The Great Dictator. This became Chaplin’s most successful movie. It was also his last great success. Essentially, Chaplin went into retirement afterwards, though he made a handful of films later on.\nCharlie Chaplin wrote, directed, and produced the films he starred in. In 1972, he was given a special Academy Award, which became known as an Oscar in later years, for his contributions to the film industry. He lived in England and the USA, but spent his last years in Switzerland, where he died in 1977. He is loved and remembered as a great actor who inspired people during dark times.",
  "rjbgz12117c9a": "Cholera used to be one of the most feared diseases in the world, until a British doctor, John Snow, showed how it could be overcome. This illness causes severe diarrhoea, dehydration, and even death. In the early 19th century, when an outbreak of cholera hit Europe, millions of people died from the disease. As a young doctor, John Snow became frustrated because no one knew how to prevent or treat cholera. In time, he rose to become a famous doctor, and even attended to Queen Victoria when she gave birth. However, he never lost his desire to destroy cholera once and for all.\nIn general, doctors in those days had two contradictory theories to explain how cholera spread. One theory was that bad air caused the disease. The other was that cholera was caused by an infection from germs in food or water. Snow subscribed to the second theory. It was correct, but he still needed proof. Consequently, when an outbreak of cholera hit London in 1854, Snow began to investigate. He discovered that in two particular streets the cholera outbreak was so severe that more than 500 people died in ten days. He was determined to find out why.\nSnow began by marking on a map the exact places where all those who died had lived. There were multiple deaths near the water pump in Broad Street (especially house numbers 16, 37, 38, and 40). However, some households (such as 20 and 21 Broad Street, and 8 and 9 Cambridge Street) had had no deaths. These people worked in the pub at 7 Cambridge Street. They had been given free beer, and so had not drunk the water from the pump. Snow suspected that the water pump was to blame. What is more, in another part of London, a woman and her daughter had died of cholera after moving away from Broad Street. It seemed that the woman liked the water from the pump so much that she had it delivered to her house every day. As a result of this evidence, John Snow was able to announce that the pump water carried cholera germs. Accordingly, he had the handle of the pump removed so that it could not be used. Through this intervention, the disease was stopped in its tracks.\nThe truth was that the water from the Broad Street pump had been infected by waste. Moreover, Snow was later able to show a link between other cases of cholera and the different water companies in London. Some companies sold water from the River Thames that was polluted by raw waste. The people who drank this water were much more likely to get cholera than those who drank pure or boiled water.\nThrough Snow’s tireless efforts, water companies began to sell clean water, and the threat of cholera around the world saw a substantial decrease. However, cholera is still a problem. Each year, millions of people around the world get cholera and many die from it. Fortunately, we now know how to prevent cholera, thanks to the work of John Snow. Moreover, in his use of maps and statistics, Snow transformed the way scientists study diseases. For this reason, Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology.",
  "rjbgz121df2c6": "## Letter Ⅰ\nDear Editor,\nIn the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people studying abroad. Although studying abroad can bring great benefits, I think the disadvantages for young people are greater.\nTo begin with, many students who study abroad face great economic pressure. That means studying abroad is just not possible for everyone. Tuition fees and living expenses are much more expensive than at home and could end up costing most families an arm and a leg. Studying in China is much more convenient and can help save money.\nAnother important factor to consider is the tremendous pressure that comes with studying abroad. Students must learn how to live in an unfamiliar environment with limited language skills. Some may struggle and suffer from culture shock when learning how to behave in new surroundings. Other students are not mature enough to handle the challenges by themselves and may become depressed. Some students might even encounter problems with personal safety. In addition, different approaches to teaching and learning may come as a shock to many students.\nA final point to consider is that while studying abroad does have potential benefits, young people who study in China also have a great future to look forward to! As China has boomed, the educational environment has improved significantly, with many great universities now available. They have great facilities and outstanding professors, helping to educate young people who will contribute to the economy and further strengthen our country.\nTo sum up, one cannot deny the fact that studying abroad has its disadvantages, so when you think about studying abroad, you should consider these many factors.\nKind regards,\nWang Li (mother of twin girls)\n\n## Letter Ⅱ\nDear Editor,\nIs studying abroad a good idea or not? There are certainly disadvantages, but in my opinion, the advantages are much greater. As I always tell my son, there are no great difficulties for a person who is brave, optimistic, and willing to work hard!\nThe first advantage of studying abroad is personal growth. The education you gain and the experiences you have will change you for the better. For example, you will certainly become more independent because you will have to deal with all kinds of difficulties by yourself. Studying abroad also helps you to gain a global perspective and improve your general competence.\nAnother advantage is the increased chance for cultural exchange. Chinese students can be seen as cultural envoys promoting friendship between nations. International students in China also bring their colourful cultures here. Cooperating with people from diverse cultural backgrounds helps us view the world from different angles and thus gives us more insight into our own culture.\nFinally, studying abroad provides a great opportunity to contribute to the development of our motherland. China’s global outlook, with projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative, has helped us make connections across the world. Therefore, China needs more talented young people with a global perspective who are highly competent with languages, have leadership and organisational skills, and have strong cultural awareness. Students who study abroad will develop such skills and abilities, and these in turn will provide them with better career opportunities.\nAll in all, studying abroad helps to build character and increase people’s understanding of cultural diversity while strengthening China and building a shared future for all. I think this life-changing experience is certainly worthwhile, and I hope my child will study abroad in the future.\nSincerely yours,\nZhang Yi (father of one boy)",
  "rjbgz12283d6d": "Is it possible to make machines think like humans? This is one question in research in the field of Artificial Intelligence, or “AI”. To think like a human, it involves feelings, morality, hopes, and dreams. Humans are capable of making decisions by themselves without input from others, and they can learn from experience. In addition, humans are able to create things from their own inspiration for their own pleasure. The question is whether machines can ever really think in all these aspects.\nThe idea of a computer that is all-powerful and can think and make decisions for itself terrifies many people. In some films, AI even decides that all humans must be killed. Many people are also concerned that AI will be used to replace humans.\nYet others are comforted by the thought of AI. Maybe with AI, robots can be made to replace loved ones who have died. Today, the creation of an all- powerful computer capable of human thought is still in progress. We have companion robots, and it is likely that they will grow more important in our lives as time goes by. However, the need for such robots does not seem to be as critical as our need for intelligent machines that can solve problems by learning from their observations and experience.\nFor example, AI is already being used with great success in Internet search engines and as a personal assistant in our smartphones. It learns from our habits to help us find what we want and like. AI is also used to diagnose problems and suggest solutions. Researchers are also experimenting with the use of AI in driverless cars which can sense their surroundings and decide on the best way to reach a destination. It is also being used in education, particularly in online courses. Furthermore, industries that use robots for repetitive or dangerous work often turn to AI to manage these electronic workers. In addition, virtual assistants are also being used in some homes today. In the near future, it is likely that AI will be used to manage smart homes and handle an even greater variety of tasks such as setting out favourite clothes and helping us with our personal grooming.\nThe AI of today has already proven its superiority to humans in many areas. Do you think that we can create a robot that thinks like a human or one that is even more intelligent? If so, is there truly a difference between AI and a human?",
  "rjbgz1240a6f1": "The French author Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once wrote, “Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are.” Put more simply, this means “You are what you eat.” Most people today relate this saying to healthy eating. However, Brillat-Savarin was actually referring to our personality, character, and culture.\nCertainly, in many ways this seems to be true. Chinese cuisine is a case in point. Prior to coming to China, my only experience with Chinese cooking was in America, with Chinese food that had been changed to suit American tastes. For example, America’s most popular Chinese dish is General Tso’s chicken, which consists of fried chicken covered in a sweet sauce, flavoured with hot red peppers. This is probably not an authentic Chinese recipe, however, so it cannot tell us much about the Chinese. On the other hand, it does tell us a lot about Americans. It tells us, for example, that Americans love bold, simple flavours. And, since the dish was also invented recently, it tells us that Americans are not afraid to try new foods.\nLater, I had a chance to experience authentic Chinese food by coming to China. When my family and I had just arrived in China, we went looking for a good place to eat in Beijing. A Sichuan restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend, and finally, we found it. Tired, hungry, and not knowing a word of Chinese, we had no idea how to order, so the chef just began filling our table with the best food we had ever eaten. With this, we had the pleasure of experiencing an entirely new taste: Sichuan peppercorns. The food was wonderful and different, but what was even more important was the friendship offered us.\nWe soon moved to Shandong Province in the eastern part of North China. My favourite dish there was boiled dumplings served with vinegar. I observed that family is important to the people there. It has become a favourite traditional dish of the people in North China, where making dumplings has always been a family affair with everyone—from the youngest to the oldest—joining in to help. Later, I learnt that the most famous food in Shandong is pancake rolls stuffed with sliced Chinese green onions.\nThen we moved to northern Xinjiang. Some of our friends were Kazak and Inner Mongolian. These groups traditionally wandered the open range on horses. As a result, their traditional foods are what you can cook over an open fire—usually boiled or roasted meat, such as lamb kebab.\nOur travels then took us to South China, and then on to central China. In each place we went, we experienced wonderful local dishes, from Guangdong’s elegant dim sum—small servings of food in bamboo steamers—to the exceptional stewed noodles in Henan. Everywhere, the food was as varied as the people. However, one thing is always true: Through food, Chinese people everywhere show friendship and kindness.\nAt a minimum, the kinds of food local people consume tell us what they grow in their region, what kinds of lives they lead, and what they like and do not like. Could we also say, for example, that those who like bold flavours are bold themselves? Or, that those who like spicy food tend to have a hot temper? Maybe. Maybe not. What we can say, however, is that culture and cuisine go hand in hand, and if you do not experience one, you can never really know the other.",
  "rjbgz12423966": "A new survey indicates that young people in China much prefer making fresh food to buying prepared food. Mei Lin, for example, is 22 and she is a college graduate from Anhui. Mei Lin has stopped buying cheap food at the supermarket. “I would much prefer my own bowl of noodles with fresh vegetables and a few spices to the packaged noodles I can buy in a store. It’s fresher and healthier, especially since I lead an active life.” Mei Lin often goes jogging in the evening and plays tennis at the weekend, in addition to swimming and training for a marathon in Xiamen in the autumn. She believes her fresh food choices help her stay fit and active.\nBut the trend isn’t one that only women are taking up. Su Bo, a 26-year-old computer programmer in Shenzhen, says that he has given up eating packaged meals except when he’s travelling for work. “For me, it’s a matter of wanting to be healthy and having enough energy. I have a very demanding job, and I need a sharp mind and strong body. It does take more time to go shopping, but I find my energy levels are higher when I eat fresh food.” Su Bo used to order many of his meals online, so that he could spend more time working, but he soon stopped this habit. “I realised it wasn’t good to never take a break from my job,” he said. “Besides, the food often made me ill.” For Su Bo this meant cooking his own vegetables, eating less meat, and carrying fruit to work for lunch. “Sometimes I buy one or two baozi from the food store on the corner, but I usually make and bring my own lunch to work.” Like Mei Lin, Su Bo insists that eating healthy food helps him with his fitness routine.\nBoth admit that in times of stress or busy periods at work, they do sometimes give in and eat fast food or packaged meals. “Sometimes I just have to eat something on the run,” says Mei Lin. “But I always regret it. I am so used to my diet now that when I eat less healthy food, I feel tired. I exercise less as a result.” Su Bo insists that he does still sometimes enjoy eating on the go. “But I almost always eat healthy meals. Because I live at home and my mother prefers to eat like I do, we often cook together. It’s my father who likes to eat fast food in front of the TV,”he laughs.\nWhen asked whether their eating habits are common among their age group, both Mei Lin and Su Bo say they are. Yet, it’s not clear whether this food trend will be adopted by other young Chinese people. Are Mei Lin and Su Bo unique or are they setting a new trend? It’s too early to say.\nCOMMENTS:\n@runnerSZ95\nI agree with this. Eating healthily is the best thing to do!\n@annalee_zhaowow\nThis is not realistic. It’s hard to cook when you work all the time! How can these two people speak for everyone?\n@jaychoulvrfan\nProcessed food makes me feel depressed. I love coming home with a shopping bag full of fresh food!",
  "rjbgz12436338": "Imagine sitting in a restaurant in a Western city and hearing from the waiter that the eggs you’re about to eat came from a farm 20 miles outside the city, that the onions came from a farm just across the road, that the peppers were grown in the restaurant’s own garden, and the cheese was made across town. This is a farm-to-table restaurant.\nThe phrase “farm-to-table” may not be one that everyone knows, but it is a common phrase when talking about a type of restaurant that some customers in Western countries prefer. Farm-to-table as a social movement has its origins in a famous San Francisco restaurant called Chez Panisse. Chef Alice Waters worked hard to learn where all of her ingredients came from, preferring whenever possible to find local food to serve in her restaurant. She did this because she preferred to have relationships with the people who supplied her food. A sense of trust soon developed between the staff of Chez Panisse and the farmers, and this meant reliable sources of produce for the restaurant’s customers. Since the food isn’t being shipped to the other side of the world, it can be picked when it is in season, allowing the plants to develop fully, resulting in better flavour and nutrition.\nThough the farm-to-table trend started in the res taurant world, customers s oon s tarte d demanding that supermarkets label where their foods come from. If you’ve ever bought blueberries from Quebec, bananas from Costa Rica, or grapes from Chile, you have seen first-hand the farm-to- table movement in action. It’s common in most supermarkets today in Western countries—and even in many Asian countries—for products to list the country of origin. This gives customers an idea of how fresh the food is likely to be or how far it has come from. This knowledge, people argue, helps customers make the best choices for themselves and their families.\nThe farm-to-table movement rides on the crest of the wave with three other movements: the slow food movement, the movement towards fresh seasonal ingredients, and the organic food movement. The term “slow food” was chosen to set it apart from “fast food”, but it really is not “slow” in the sense of eating or cooking food slowly. Rather, the slow food movement celebrates traditional food made with local ingredients and traditional cooking techniques. It sees a strong link between food and culture, and wants to protect local food heritage as a way of protecting local culture. As such, it heavily depends on local farmers and other food producers. While not all farm-to-table restaurants are part of the slow food movement, all slow food restaurants are essentially farm-to-table.\nPrior to modern food processing and storage techniques and the use of greenhouses, most food was essentially seasonal in nature. That is, you could only find certain food ingredients at certain times of the year. As a consequence, people looked forward to seasons and seasonal celebrations in large part because of the food available at that time. Modern technology has made food much more convenient, but with that it has also taken away some of the things that made food wonderful. Not only is our food often lacking in flavour and nutrition, but we have lost touch with some of our cultural heritage and the rhythms of nature, and the joy of anticipation has been lost. As a consequence, many people are embracing seasonal cuisine by consuming only fresh ingredients that are in season. Farm-to-table goes hand-in-hand with this new emphasis, as this is one way to ensure that only fresh seasonal ingredients are being used, rather than ingredients which have been processed, which have been stored for many months at a time, or which originated in greenhouses.\nThe idea behind organic food is that food is grown and processed in ways that use as few chemicals as possible. This is seen as being better for our health, and better for the earth. The farm-to-table movement believes that food should be grown, shipped, stored, and prepared as naturally as possible.\nFraud, however, has become a problem in the farm-to-table movement. Investigations have shown that some supermarkets, for example, have claimed that their apples came from Washington when they really came from Mexico, and restaurants have claimed that a fish is one species when it’s a different one. Why does this matter? Because farm-to-table is a movement about trust: trust that food is grown in healthy and clean environments, and trust that the people who buy such food have developed personal relationships with the people who grow it.\nSome people do not support the farm-to-table movement. They insist that the nutritional value of local food is not any greater than mass-produced food shipped from far away. At the same time, local food can cost a lot more. This has resulted in some saying that farm-to-table is a movement that meets the desires of people with money, but does not really address any actual nutritional or environmental concerns. Poor people, in other words, cannot afford to worry about where their food comes from. It is true that many poor people in the West cannot afford to buy farm-to-table food from expensive supermarkets. On the other hand, in most developing countries poor people already have farm-to-table diets because they live on or near farms and this is the only food available.\nWhether farm-to-table is a long-term trend or a passing fad isn’t clear. But people today are more demanding when it comes to getting information about their food from restaurants and market owners. This new type of communication between customers and businesses is unlikely to go away anytime soon.",
  "rjbgz12445fe1": "Stephen Hawking was one of the most famous and gifted scientists in physics. Most people are familiar with images of him in his wheelchair, unable to move and using a computer to talk. Since he came down with a disease which caused him to lose the use of most of his muscles, his world became one of abstract thought.\nHawking first achieved fame when he was still healthy enough to walk, as a graduate student in physics at Cambridge University in 1964. In general, there were two main theories on the origin of the universe. The first was the steady state theory, which holds that the universe has no beginning or end. The other was the big bang theory, which holds that the universe began at a single point in time and space. The biggest champion of the steady state concept was Fred Hoyle, a professor at Cambridge. During the question and answer period after one of Hoyle’s lectures, Hawking stood up and pointed out that Hoyle had made a mistake in his maths. Once the maths was corrected, it showed that the big bang theory—and not the steady state theory—was true. Hawking’s own work on the big bang theory was soon proven by astronomers with telescopes. A star was born.\nSo, what made Stephen Hawking a genius? Besides being brilliant, he was brave, though sometimes careless in what he said or did. He was willing to say what others were afraid to say, and to dream of what others were afraid to dream about. Furthermore, he was quite determined. This had helped him as a scientist, and had helped him even more in his fight against his disease. Above all, Hawking was willing to admit his faults. This odd combination of characteristics had made him one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th and 21st centuries.",
  "rjbgz12545573": "There is much debate nowadays as to what makes up a healthy diet. For example, scientists have insisted for years that a big enemy of health is fatty food. However, there is increasing evidence that the real driver of poor health is not so much fatty food, as it is sugar. Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans. And in America, people who receive 25% of their daily calories or more through sugar are twice as likely to die from heart disease than people who receive less than 10% a day (Journal of the American Medical Association, 2014). This is true regardless of how healthy the rest of their diet might be. Put more simply, while people continue to argue over whether or not fatty food is dangerous, we already know that sugar is a killer.\nMuch of this extra sugar comes from sweets and sweet drinks. The average American gets 1/3 of his or her sugar through sweet drinks alone. The American Heart Association recommends that we limit ourselves to less than 100–150 calories a day from sugar, which is less than what is usually contained in one can of sweet drink or in a single candy bar. In other words, if you want to be healthy, you have to cut down on desserts, and cut out sweet drinks altogether.\nBeyond this, you can keep healthy by consuming different categories of fresh foods, especially fruit and vegetables, which are full of vitamins and fibre, rather than processed foods. Processed foods often contain less nutrition, and have higher quantities of sugar, salt, and fat than fresh ingredients. Besides this, it is also important to have some meat, beans, or dairy products in your diet, as they provide the necessary protein for strong bones and muscle growth. As with everything in life, moderation is key. The ideal diet is a balanced one, without too much or too little of any one thing.\nFinally, a fundamental key to healthy eating is to eat slowly. It takes about twenty minutes from the time you start eating for your brain to tell your body that you are full. What this means is that people who chew too quickly end up eating too much food because they still feel hungry. Eating slowly also allows your body to digest your food better, and will allow you to enjoy your food more. In addition, studies show that consistent eating habits, for example, taking three meals a day at the same time each day, are better for our health. It is also better to eat a modest amount of food each time, rather than to eat a lot in one meal, and then a little in the next.\nThere is no one trick to healthy eating. Rather, healthy eating starts with having a healthy attitude towards food. One question you can ask yourself is, “Do I eat to live, or live to eat?” If you are using food mostly for nutrition, then you are on the right track with your diet. However, if food has become the centre of your life, you might be on the road to bad health. It is up to you to decide how you want to live, and to make the right decisions about your diet.",
  "rjbgz12593e1c": "Some people are born with a vision and desire to help others. For other people, however, this calling comes unexpectedly, like a lion that attacks its prey by surprise. This was certainly true of Swiss businessman Henry Dunant. In 1859, Dunant travelled to Italy wanting to see Napoleon III, the Emperor of France. At the age of 31, Dunant was already a successful businessman. However, he needed the help of Napoleon III for one of his business deals. At the time, France was fighting with the Italian army in a war against Austria. Dunant knew that Napoleon III would be with his army in northern Italy, so he travelled to the city of Solferino to look for him.\nDunant arrived on the night of 24 June and found a battlefield filled with 40,000 dead and wounded soldiers. Dunant was horrified by the scene and was filled with compassion for the wounded men. At once, Dunant forgot all about seeing Napoleon III and began attending to the wounded men. In the days that followed, he led local people in helping take care of the wounded and dying. They looked after the soldiers without regard to country or uniform, saying, “All are brothers!” After all the wounded in Solferino had either died or been taken away, Dunant went to military hospitals and continued to act as a volunteer, helping as best as he could.\nWhen Dunant returned to Switzerland the following month, he wrote a book about his experience called A Memory of Solferino. The book ends with a simple question: “Would it not be possible, in time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose of having care given to the wounded in wartime by zealous, devoted, and thoroughly qualified volunteers?” This question eventually led to the forming of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863.\nThe first act of the Red Cross was to organise an international conference (the Geneva Convention) where countries adopted guidelines and measures for protecting the wounded and medical workers during and after battles. In the years since then, the Red Cross has been active in just about every war, helping to care for both soldiers and civilians. While the Red Cross is mostly tasked with helping people in times of war, it also responds to natural disasters and gives aid to people who have to leave their homes. For example, the Red Cross provided aid and relief after the May 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake in Sichuan, China.\nAll around the world, the Red Cross continues to help civilians caught in war, providing medical assistance, feeding the needy, and offering many other types of aid. To help meet the need for aid, most countries have National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Not only do these societies provide support to Red Cross efforts in other countries, but they also help prepare their own communities for disasters, provide medical services, and teach first-aid and life-saving techniques.\nMuch of the work done by volunteers and workers in the Red Cross is difficult. They tend to work in places of crisis, where there is war, conflict, or disaster, and where conditions are quite poor. However, their work is also both rewarding and important. They provide food, shelter, medical supplies, and medical care to those in need. They help prepare communities and gather supplies and materials for future disasters. And, in many cases, they remain at work even after conflicts and disasters have passed, and lead development efforts.\nSometimes the work is even dangerous. Since 1993, about 40 workers for the International Red Cross have been killed. However, Red Cross workers think that it is worth it. As one Red Cross volunteer said, “We are the Red Cross—we will be there. No matter how hard it is, we will be there.”\nMost of the people who receive help from the Red Cross are very grateful for the help, and some even want to return the favour and help others now that they themselves have received help. For example, Salaymana is now a volunteer with the Italian Red Cross. In 2016, he escaped from conflict in his home country in Africa by getting on a boat to Italy. Crossing the Mediterranean in a small boat was very hard, and many of the people who travelled with him died during the journey. However, when Salaymana arrived in Italy, the first people he met were Red Cross volunteers, who gave him food, medical attention, a place to stay, and much needed comfort. As Salaymana said later, “I am very happy now. They are my brothers, and the Red Cross is always in my heart.”\nDunant himself gave up everything he had to help others. His business failed because he was too busy with his work in the Red Cross. Then Dunant had to leave the Red Cross because of a personal conflict. Despite this, he continued to work as a volunteer, helping provide relief to people caught up in war. In the end, he lost all his money, fell ill, and had to be taken in by a charity. By this time, the Red Cross had become famous, but he was mostly forgotten. In the last years of his life, though, he was discovered by a newspaper reporter. From then on, he was celebrated around the world as the man responsible for saving many thousands of lives. Though he is long gone, his spirit continues with us until this day.",
  "rjbgz125b7996": "The skin is an essential part of your body and is its largest organ. Your skin acts as a barrier against disease, toxins, and the sun’s rays. It also helps control your body temperature, prevents your body from losing too much water, warns you when things are too hot or cold, and gives you your sense of touch. As you can imagine, getting burnt can lead to very serious injuries. The first and most important step in the treatment of burns is giving first aid.\n## CAUSES OF BURNS\nYou can get burnt by a variety of things: hot liquids, steam, fire, radiation, the sun, electricity, acids, or other chemicals.\n## TYPES OF BURNS\nBurns are divided into three types, depending on the depth of skin damage.\n\n• First-degree burns: These affect only the top few millimetres of the skin. These burns are not serious. Examples include mild sunburn and burns caused by other minor household incidents.\n• Second-degree burns: These go below the top layer of the skin. They are serious and take a few weeks to get better. Examples include burns caused by hot liquids.\n• Third-degree burns: These affect every layer of the skin, and sometimes the tissue under it. Examples include burns caused by electric shocks, burning clothes, or petrol fires. These burns cause very severe internal injuries and the victim must go to the hospital at once.\n## CHARACTERISTICS OF BURNS\n### First-degree burns\n• dry, red, and mildly swollen\n• mildly painful\n• turn white when pressed\n### Second-degree burns\n• red and swollen; blisters; watery surface\n• extremely painful\n### Third-degree burns\n• black and white \n• swollen; the tissue underneath can often be seen\n• little or no pain if nerves are damaged; may be painful around the edges of the burn\n\n## FIRST-AID TREATMENT\n1 Place burns under cool running water, especially within the first ten minutes. The cool water stops the burning process and reduces the pain and swelling.\n2 Dry the burnt area gently with a clean cloth.\n3 Remove any clothes using scissors if necessary, unless you see the fabric sticking to the burnt skin.\n4 Cover the burnt area with a loose clean cloth. Applying oil to the injured areas is a bad idea, as it will keep the heat in the wounds and may cause infection.\n5 If burns are on the face, make sure the victim can still breathe.\n6 If the victim is suffering from second or third-degree burns, there is an urgent need to take him/her to the hospital at once.",

This young boy was Zhan Tianyou, who was destined to play a major role in the development of China’s railroads. Zhan Tianyou was one of the first 30 boys chosen to be part of the Chinese Educational Mission (CEM), which had been founded by the Chinese government at the time with the goal of helping China to develop and strengthen through education.\nIt was not easy, however, to recruit 30 boys whose parents were willing to part with their sons for fifteen years, which was the original plan of the CEM. No one knew what to expect if their children were to be separated from them by thousands of miles for more than a decade. Few people had any experience travelling to countries outside China, and many were afraid of foreigners. A friend persuaded Zhan Tianyou’s father to send his son for the CEM admission test, and eventually Zhan Tianyou joined the small group of boys sailing across the Pacific to the USA.\nAfter the ship reached the US west coast, Zhan Tianyou and the other students had to travel by train across America to reach their schools on the east coast. On the way, the young Chinese boy drank in the amazing natural scenery, the culture and customs, and the developing American industrial civilisation. Looking back years later, he remembered that he had been especially impressed by the amazing railroads and trains.\nZhan Tianyou and his fellow students received a warm welcome from the school and their homestay families when they finally arrived in the state of Connecticut. For the first two years in Connecticut, Zhan Tianyou attended the Seaside Institute for Boys, where he became very close friends with the headmaster and his family. The headmaster’s wife, Mrs Martha Northrop, was an especially good friend and positive influence, encouraging the young Chinese boy to study science and engineering after he displayed a talent for maths. Many years later, Zhan Tianyou wrote to Mrs Northrop to express his great gratitude for her kindness and help during those early years.\nDuring his two years at the boys’ school, Zhan Tianyou embraced as many opportunities as he could to learn about this new world. He took part in all sorts of sports, games, and other activities: swimming, skating, ball games, fishing, riding bicycles, playing chess, and more. He also became interested in travel and reading, especially Mark Twain’s novels. When he entered high school, he continued to participate in many different sports and other activities, even forming a baseball team with the other Chinese students attending the high school. Their team often competed with teams from different parts of the USA.\nZhan Tianyou did not, however, neglect his studies to pursue sports or play games. He greatly expanded his understanding of science and Western culture, took part in natural and social research, and eventually graduated first in his class and second in the whole school.\nWhile in high school, Zhan Tianyou became increasingly interested in the rapid development of modern science and technology. He was impressed by the new American railroad system and the hard work of the Chinese workers who helped to build it. During a visit to Philadelphia, he was amazed by the many displays of science and technology at the Centennial Exposition (later renamed the World Fair). He was also saddened to see that only a few items were displayed by the Chinese representatives at the exposition: mostly tea, silk, and porcelain.\nThose first five years of observation and experience, the great encouragement of his good friend Mrs Northrop, and his great desire to help his home country led him to a very clear choice of major in college: civil engineering, with an emphasis on railroad construction. He had seen first-hand how building railroads had greatly assisted America’s growth, and he felt that China would benefit similarly from having railroads.\nTherefore, at the age of 17, Zhan Tianyou entered Yale University’s Sheffield Scientific School to study civil engineering. His hard work won him a scholarship and a medal in maths during his time there. He graduated in 1881 with a Ph.B. degree, ranking first in the graduation exams. Of the 120 Chinese boys who came to the US through the CEM, only Zhan Tianyou and another student completed college degrees, as in the summer of 1881, the Qing government decided to recall the CEM students.\nZhan Tianyou returned to China with a great desire to use his education and experience to build up his country. Seven years later, in 1888, he finally began to realise his dream of building a railroad system in China. He became particularly famous for his amazing work on the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway, a railway line built across some of the most difficult geographical conditions in China. Zhan Tianyou, now known as the Father of China’s Railroad, served his country for 31 years, improving life for millions of people.",

  "rjbgz1299fd72": "After Li Daiyu and her cousin arrived in Toronto, the largest and wealthiest city in Canada, they only had a few hours to kill before they had to proceed to the next leg of their trip to Montreal, so they went on a tour of the city. They went up the CN Tower and looked across the shores of Lake Ontario. Standing in the distance, they were astonished to see misty clouds rising from the great Niagara Falls, which is on the south side of the lake. Water from the lake flows into the Niagara River and over the falls on its way to the sea.\nThe girls saw hundreds of skyscrapers of glass and steel, and old-fashioned cars rolling by. As they walked north from the harbour area, Li Daiyu said, “Lin Fei, one of my mother’s old schoolmates, lives here. I should phone her and see if she’s available for dinner.”\nThey met Lin Fei around dusk over dinner at a restaurant in downtown Chinatown. The cousins chatted with Lin Fei, who had moved to Canada many years earlier.\n“This is the largest Chinatown in Toronto. We have a few more in the Greater Toronto Area, so you can guess that there are a lot of Chinese people in Canada! Chinese people have been coming here for more than a hundred years. Therefore, we can get all kinds of great food here from all over China,” Lin Fei told them.\nThe train left late that night and arrived in Montreal early the next morning. At the station, in contrast to Toronto, they heard people talking in French. They were surprised to see that all the signs and advertisements were in French and many people spoke English with an accent.\n“We don’t leave until this evening,” said Liu Qian. “Let’s go downtown. Old Montreal is close to the water.”\nThey spent the afternoon in lovely shops and visiting artists in their workplaces along St Paul Street. As they sat in a restaurant alongside the broad St Lawrence River, a young man sat down with them.\n“Hello, my name is Jean-Philippe. I’m a photographer,” he said, “and I was wondering where you are from.”\nThe girls told him they were from China and were on a train trip across Canada. When they told him they had only one day in Montreal, he said, “That’s too bad. You owe it to yourselves to stay longer. Overall, Montreal is a city with wonderful sights and sounds. Most of us speak both English and French, and the city has unique Quebec culture and traditions. There are fantastic restaurants and clubs around, too. Here, we love good coffee, toast, and cheese. And good music, of course!”\nThat night the train was speeding along the St Lawrence River towards the Gulf of St Lawrence and down to the distant east coast towards the province of Nova Scotia and its largest city, Halifax. The cousins dreamt happily of the beautiful cobblestone streets, old brick buildings, and the red maple leaves of Montreal.",
  "rjbgz129c956a": "Six months ago, 19-year-old Xie Lei said goodbye to her family and friends and boarded a plane for London. It was the first time that she had left China.\n“I was very excited but also quite nervous. I didn’t know what to expect,” Xie Lei recalled.\nXie Lei is studying for a business qualification at a university in China and has come to our university on a year-long exchange programme. “I chose the exchange programme because I wanted to learn about global business and improve my English. My ambition is to set up a business in China after graduation,” she explained.\nAt first, Xie Lei had to adapt to life in a different country. “You have to get used to a whole new life,” she said. “I had to learn how to use public transport and how to ask for things I didn’t know the English names for. When I got lost, I had to ask passers-by for help, but people here speak fast and use words I’m not familiar with. I ask them to repeat themselves a lot!”\nAlthough some foreign students live in campus accommodation, Xie Lei chose to live with a host family, who can help with her adaptation to the new culture. “When I miss home, I feel comforted to have a second family,” Xie Lei said. “When there’s something I don’t know or understand, I can ask them. They are also keen to learn about China. Laura, the daughter of my host family, wants to study in China in the future. We take turns to cook each evening. They really love my stir-fried tomatoes and eggs! Laura says she always feels hungry when she smells it, so I taught her how to cook it, too.”\nAnother challenge for Xie Lei is the academic requirements. The first time that she had to write an essay, her tutor explained that she must acknowledge what other people had said if she cited their ideas, but that he mainly wanted to know what she thought! Xie Lei was confused because she thought she knew less than other people. Her tutor advised her to read lots of information in order to form a wise opinion of her own.\nXie Lei also found many courses included students’ participation in class as part of the final result. Students need to generate ideas, offer examples, apply concepts, and raise questions, as well as give presentations. At first, Xie Lei had no idea what she should say, but what surprised her was that she found herself speaking up in class after just a few weeks. “My presentation on traditional Chinese art was a great success, which boosted my confidence,” she said. “I’ll use these skills back home for presentations. They’ll help me build a strong business in the future.”\nNow halfway through her exchange year, Xie Lei feels much more at home in the UK. What seemed strange before now appears quite normal to her.“Engaging in British culture has helped,” she said.“As well as studying hard, I’ve been involved in social activities. British people are fascinated by our culture and eager to learn more about it, so I’m keen to share my culture with them. While I’m learning about business, I’m also acting as a cultural messenger building a bridge between us.”\nWe will follow Xie Lei’s progress in later editions, but for now, we wish her all the best.",
  "rjbgz129e20f9": "Everyone is quiet as they enter the narrow room. The crowd ignores the many beautiful paintings on the walls and pushes to the room’s far end. There, they gaze at a single small painting of a smiling woman. So many people have crowded in to have a look at the painting that most can only get a quick look at it. Then they are forced to move on.\nThis painting is the Mona Lisa created in the early 16th century by the Italian painter Leonardo da Vinci. It was kept away from the public until 1797, when it was put on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Art critics only first began to notice the painting in the 1850s. Then, in 1911, the painting was stolen. By the time the painting was finally recovered in 1914, it had become an international sensation. Many agreed that it was one of the greatest paintings ever made, by one of the world’s greatest painters.\nEven as a young boy, da Vinci showed promise as an artist. When he was fourteen years old, he was sent to learn art in Florence, Italy. He trained for seven years, and then struck out on his own, working for wealthy men throughout Italy, and later for the king of France. Even though Leonardo began his career as a painter, he most often worked as an engineer. One reason was that he painted very slowly, and sometimes did not even finish his work. Another reason was that Italy was at war, and people needed engineers to help build city defences more than they needed artists. However, even though da Vinci worked as an engineer, he still found time to paint, creating some of his greatest artworks during this period.\nAfter da Vinci’s death, it was discovered that he had kept many notebooks describing and illustrating his work, his inventions, and his scientific research. While his notebooks were collected and prized by the kings of Europe, none of them were published until the late 19th century. Until then, few people had had any idea what they contained.\nAs it turned out, his notebooks are an amazing treasure box of drawings of people, animals, plants, and fantastic inventions, such as airplanes, tanks, robots, and diving equipment. Then, there are accurate studies of the human body, showing bones and muscles with such detail that would not be seen elsewhere for four hundred years. Along with these drawings are notes describing his work. Oddly, many of these notes are written backwards: You have to hold them up to the mirror in order to read them. Many of these notes are scientific in nature, involving his research in many different fields. His notebooks show that he was not only the greatest artist of his time, but the greatest scientist as well.\nThis raises the question: What was more important to da Vinci, science or art? Da Vinci once said, “Practice must always be founded on sound theory ... The painter who draws merely by practice and by eye, without any reason, is like a mirror which copies everything placed in front of it but does not know those things exist.” Here, “reason” means an understanding of what is being painted. In da Vinci’s mind, before he could paint something, he had to examine it, take it apart, and even see how it worked. Thus, his scientific research served his art.\nYet, this is too simple of a picture of the man. Da Vinci was always full of excitement to explore, to discover, and to create. He saw no division between art, invention, and science—they were all a part of his wonderful new world of discovery. Thus, some of da Vinci’s paintings were really science experiments, in that they used new chemicals and processes from his research. At the same time, his scientific drawings are considered beautiful pieces of art in their own right, and many of them were created to help him understand what he was painting. Da Vinci’s desire to create and his interest in the world around him drove both his art and his science.\nSo what can we learn from this? Few of us will ever be as gifted and intelligent as da Vinci. Yet, all of us can learn from his spirit. We can produce things of beauty, create new inventions, and increase our scientific knowledge. Furthermore, we can be creative in solving difficult problems. While none of us may ever be able to paint something as beautiful as the Mona Lisa, we can all do our small part to make the world a better place.",
  "rjbgz12b2e179": "Chen Wei, a high school student in Beijing, had his dinner interrupted when he heard someone screaming from another table. A fellow diner at the restaurant, Zhang Tao, was choking on some steak. He was now holding his throat with his face turning red, while his desperate friends were slapping him on the back.\nChen wasted no time. He got up and ran to Zhang’s table at once. With the help of Zhang’s friends, he was able to help Zhang to his feet. Then, standing behind Zhang, Chen did the Heimlich manoeuvre. The food was instantly forced out, and Zhang began to breathe again. Ten minutes later, an ambulance arrived. The doctors checked Zhang and made sure that he was fine. They suggested he eat more slowly and take smaller bites before they left.\nChoking victims usually have only about four minutes before they collapse and sometimes die, leaving no time for an ambulance to arrive. To solve this problem, in 1974, an American doctor, Henry Heimlich, created the Heimlich manoeuvre, saving thousands of lives around the world. Doing the Heimlich manoeuvre is quick, practical, and easy. It is so easy, in fact, that almost anyone can learn how.\nIf you see someone choking, first call the emergency services. Then, make sure that the victim is really choking: A choking person cannot speak. Slapping the victim’s back will often force out the obstruction. If this does not work, you can perform the Heimlich manoeuvre by standing behind him and wrapping your arms around his waist. Make a fist with one hand and place it in the upper part of his stomach. Grabbing your fist with your other hand tightly, push up and into his stomach in one motion. Continue doing this until the obstruction is forced out.\nDoing the Heimlich manoeuvre on a small child is not recommended, as you may hurt him. Instead, lay the child face down on your lap with the head lower than the rest of his body, and then give firm slaps to his upper back until he can breathe again.\nWith choking victims, every minute counts. You cannot just stand by and do nothing. Luckily, Chen had learnt how to give first aid in school. Seeing Zhang choking, he remained calm and reacted immediately. Chen later said about the incident, “How could I justify sitting there and doing nothing? We are all humans and we all have a responsibility to look after one another’s welfare.”",
  "rjbgz12b8240a": "To: joan.ford@hs.com\nSubject: Life in China\nHi there, Aunt Joan!\nHow are you? Mum said you asked how I was doing, so let me tell you about my life here.\nAs you know, I’ve been in China for around a month now. I want to study in a local university, which is why I took those after-school Chinese classes. I decided on China because it’s a fast-developing country with trade links all over the world. Studying here could be useful in finding a good job in trade or business. What’s more, Chinese culture is really interesting, so choosing to come here was a no-brainer for me!\nHaving said that, China isn’t like I thought it might be. I thought it would be quite old and traditional, but in many ways, the cities are just as modern as back home in Vancouver, only with lots more people! There’s so much more food to try, too, and it’s all delicious! Everywhere I go, I see restaurants and snack stalls—it seems to be a big part of their culture. Food here is very reasonably priced, so it’s great for my budget. The people I meet are all very welcoming towards me as a foreigner, and I even seem to be a point of interest! However, hardly anyone speaks English in my area, so it can be a bit overwhelming at times. But I guess that’s why I’m here—to learn.\nRight now, I’m studying every day for my HSK exam (a Chinese language qualification). But I also get a chance to explore the city. I usually get up extra early each morning to enjoy a freshly made breakfast on the street, and then I often visit a park. I’m not sure if you know, but I’m really interested in tai chi, so I spend a lot of time in the city parks practising with the locals. There’s a lot of traditional culture still alive in China. The parks are full of people playing traditional instruments, playing Chinese chess, and even writing calligraphy on the ground with giant paintbrushes!\nMy long-term plan is to take a degree course here. But it all depends on my expenses, so I intend to find some work first. I’m staying in a hostel dormitory right now, but I’ve put an ad online to find a friendly Chinese family for a homestay. That way, my Chinese will improve much faster, especially my written Chinese, which I find the most difficult to grasp. I’ll get more exposure to Chinese culture, too. I hope I can learn some Chinese food recipes from them. I promise to make everyone a meal when I return!\nWell, that’s all for now. I’ve attached a few photos for you. You would really love it here, so I hope you guys can visit China some time!\nTake care!\nJim",
  "rjbgz12ba2194": "About 120 years ago, gold was discovered in the Yukon, in northern Canada, starting a gold rush as tens of thousands of men—and women—travelled there from around the world in the hope of making their fortunes. There were no real roads in that area back then, so it was difficult to travel overland in summer. However, once the ground was covered in ice and snow, one could travel long distances quickly by sled. Of course, the winter weather was too harsh for horses—they would die in the cold. Dogs, on the other hand, thrived in the cold because of their thick fur, so then—and even now—dogs were used on long journeys through the snow carrying people and goods on sleds. As a young man, Jack London joined the gold rush and journeyed from California to Alaska and the Yukon. Though, like most miners, he did not get rich looking for gold, he saw first-hand how dogs were a necessary part of travel in the far north. Some friends he met there had a large dog, a husky and St Bernard mixed breed. This dog seemed particularly tough and healthy and served as inspiration for the main dog character in London’s novel, The Call of the Wild.\nLondon thought of his time in the north as one of his life’s greatest adventures. When he returned to California, he was unable to find a job. Those were difficult times in California, which was still isolated and cut off from much of the American economy. With Alaska fresh in his mind, he tried to sell the story of his journey up north to several publishers and magazines, but no one seemed interested. Later, London wrote a short story about a dog in the far north who survives many adventures and ends up killing his master. But almost immediately after its publication, London regretted it and felt that he needed to “set the story straight” by showing how noble and loyal dogs were, especially dogs in the far north, where travel and survival was difficult. It was this that started him writing his famous novel, The Call of the Wild. The new story was quickly picked up by a magazine and serialised into four parts. It became extremely popular. Later, it was published in book format and has never been out of print since.\nThe hero of London’s novel was Buck, a large family dog owned by a wealthy judge:\n> “Buck was neither house-dog nor kennel-dog. The whole realm was his ... he was king—king over all creeping, crawling, flying things of Judge Miller’s place, humans included. His father, Elmo, a huge St Bernard, had been the Judge’s inseparable companion, and Buck bid fair to follow in the way of his father. He was not so large—he weighed only one hundred and forty pounds—for his mother, Shep, had been a Scotch shepherd dog. Nevertheless, one hundred and forty pounds, to which was added the dignity that comes of good living and universal respect, enabled him to carry himself in right royal fashion. During the four years since his puppyhood he had lived the life of a sated aristocrat; he had a fine pride in himself, was even a trifle egotistical, as country gentlemen sometimes become because of their insular situation. But he saved himself by not becoming a mere pampered house-dog. Hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.”\nBuck’s life was wonderful and happy, until he was stolen and sold to men who took him to Canada, where he became a sled dog used for travel in the harsh Yukon winter. The book was an early example of an adventure tale told from an animal’s point of view, by an animal with human emotions and ways of seeing the world:\n> “Close in under the sheltering rock Buck made his nest. So snug and warm was it, that he was loath to leave it when Francois distributed the fish which he had first thawed over the fire. But when Buck finished his ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. A warning snarl told him that the trespasser was Spitz. Till now Buck had avoided trouble with his enemy, but this was too much. The beast in him roared. He sprang upon Spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and Spitz particularly, for his whole experience with Buck had gone to teach him that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own only because of his great weight and size.”\nThe excerpt above shows how London created a dog that not only had qualities that humans recognise in dogs, but also an emotional complexity that humans also recognise in each other. In this way, London was able to create a character that was both non-human and human. This made the adventure tale engaging and fascinating, offering urban Americans insight into what life in the far north was like for dogs and humans.\nJust as Buck as a dog is used to pull sleds on long journeys, the story itself is one of a long inner journey. Buck begins his life in a comfortable, loving home where he must depend upon his human master for everything. But later he is forced to survive under harsh circumstances in a difficult environment. There, however, he finds a strength that he did not realise he had, and becomes an essential part of his owner’s life. Yet, as much as his human owner needs Buck for survival, Buck discovers that he no longer needs humans. So, when his owner dies, he escapes into the forest and joins the wolves, finally discovering true freedom and independence.\nSadly, Jack London died young in 1916 at the age of 40. There is debate about how he died exactly, as London had suffered from several painful diseases in the last years of his life, including scurvy which had been caused by his travels in the Yukon earlier in life. After his death, interest in The Call of the Wild, and some of his other works, grew much stronger. Romantic ideas of the tragic author who passed away when he was still young and handsome made his works even more popular. Today, The Call of the Wild is considered one of the most important novels of American literature, and students in high school and college are often required to read it.",
  "rjbgz12cc009e": "Li Daiyu and her cousin Liu Qian went to Canada to visit their cousins in Halifax on the Atlantic coast. Rather than travel by commercial airline all the way, they decided to fly to Vancouver and then take whole the country train. For both of them, the thought of crossing the whole country by rail was of exciting.\nBefore starting out, they spent a couple of days in Vancouver, seeing the sights. During their first day, as is typical of Vancouver, it rained. Despite the weather, they were able to take a boat ride out into the bay, and later visit an island that had wonderful shops selling crafts and antiques. The next day was clear and mild, and they were pleased to see the beautiful mountains looking out over the city. Later, they took a pleasant hike in a forest just a short distance away.\nThe next morning, the two girls arose early to take the train to Lake Louise, passing through the Canadian Rockies. Seen from the train window, the mountains and forests of Canada looked massive. When the train arrived at the station, they took a taxi to Lake Louise, where the blue water literally took their breath away with its exceptional beauty. They spent the night, and then took a coach bound north through the Canadian Rockies to Jasper. Looking at the beautiful scenery, they both agreed that it was the most awesome journey they had ever taken. In addition to seeing spectacular mountain peaks and forests, one highlight of their trip was being able to see many different creatures, including deer, mountain goats, and even a grizzly bear and an eagle.\nFrom Jasper, they caught the train towards Toronto. One of the train’s first stops was in Edmonton, the provincial capital of Alberta, the centre of Canada’s huge oil and gas drilling industry. Edmonton is freezing cold in winter, with daily temperatures averaging -10 ̊C. Since it can be too cold to go outdoors, Edmonton is home to many shopping malls. In fact, one of the largest shopping malls in North America is in Edmonton.\nFrom Edmonton, the train headed southeast across the great Canadian Prairie. At school, Daiyu and Liu Qian had learnt that Canada’s population is only slightly over thirty-seven million. However, they did not anticipate seeing such an open country, and were truly amazed. They went through two wheat-growing provinces, where they saw a bunch of farms that covered a very large area.\nAfter another day on the train, eventually they were back in an urban area, the city of Winnipeg. From there, they travelled through the night, and woke up in Ontario—a land of forests and lakes. The train thundered on, through the rolling hills. The bushes and maple trees outside their windows were red, gold, and orange, and there was frost on the ground, confirming that autumn had arrived in Canada. Night came again, and the train turned south towards Toronto. When they woke up the next morning and pulled back the curtain, they could see the wide stretch of Lake Huron—one of the four Great Lakes on Ontario’s southern border. It was not until 9:30 a.m. that they finally reached the capital of Ontario, Toronto. All in all, their trip from Vancouver to Toronto had taken a duration of four days.",
  "rjbgz12e3fab8": "\nPerhaps no other scientist has had a greater impact on China’s aerospace science than Qian Xuesen. Described by the authors of the Story of Qian Xuesen as a man with “great scientific thought and scientific spirit” who was patriotic and served his homeland with effort, achievement, and devotion, Qian was an extremely well-respected man.\nBorn in Shanghai in 1911, Qian attended schools in Beijing and then entered Shanghai Jiao Tong University to study Railway Mechanical Engineering. However, after the Songhu Battle broke out in 1932, Qian made the decision to switch his major to aviation because he realised that China needed its own powerful air force to protect and defend the country.\nQian went to the United States in 1935 to pursue his graduate studies. Over the course of the 1930s and 1940s, Qian became a pioneer in American jet and rocket technology. As a graduate assistant at the California Institute of Technology during the 1930s, Qian helped conduct important research into rocket propulsion, and in the 1940s, he and several other people founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, now one of NASA’s leading space-exploration centres.\nAfter overcoming some difficulties during his final few years in the US, Qian returned to China in 1955. He received a hero’s welcome from his homeland and was put in charge of not only developing China’s rocket science but also its space and missile programme. At that time, China was poor and its rocket science was undeveloped. No institute or university in China offered rocket science as a major, and there were no talents or experts in this field in China. Nevertheless, Qian did not let that discourage him from taking on the challenge. When asked “Can we Chinese possibly make missiles?”, his reply was a determined “Why not? We Chinese are able to make the same things that other people make.”\nUnder Qian’s leadership, China developed the Dongfeng missiles, followed by the first generation of Long March rockets. In 1970, China successfully launched its first man-made satellite, Dong Fang Hong I, from a Long March rocket. Because much of the technology behind the Shenzhou rockets can also be traced back to Qian’s research, Qian earned the name of “the father of China’s aerospace”.\nQian read a lot and was extremely knowledgeable, especially in the area of frontier science research. However, what might have made him such an outstanding and creative scientist was probably his strong interest in other things, such as music and drawing. His deep appreciation for art often gave him inspiration in his scientific research.\nOn 31 October 2009, the whole country was saddened by Qian’s death, and people honoured and remembered him in different ways.",

The sun is already burning hot even though it has not yet reached full strength, but a calm breeze cools my skin. So far the day is wonderful, but the purpose of my trip is not just to have fun: I am following in the footsteps of Xu Xiake (1587–1641), the famous Chinese travel writer and geographer. Though Xu was from Jiangsu, he spent more than 30 years travelling throughout the country, and greatly admired my destination today—Ox Gorge.\nAs we flow down the river, we are surrounded by steep hills sticking up into the sky—karsts. Unique among mountains, karsts were formed over thousands of years as rain drained into the acidic soil and melted the soft rock, leaving the harder rock behind. Guangxi is full of karsts, giving it some of the most interesting—and beautiful—scenery in the world. Xu was one of the first people to make a careful study of Guilin’s karsts and their related cave systems. He, like many people today, found them fascinating.\nSuddenly, our raft hits some rapids, and I find myself covered in water. I turn to my raftsman and we share a laugh. The water not only keeps us cool, but it is all part of the adventure.\nWhat made someone like Xu spend years travelling thousands of kilometres away from home? Perhaps it’s the same reason as mine: to explore the world and to discover new things. As Xu wrote, “A great man should in the morning be at the blue sea, and in the evening at Mount Cangwu. Why should I restrict myself to one corner of the world?”\nXu was not alone. Much like today, the late Ming Dynasty was a golden age of tourism within China. People travelled hundreds of kilometres to visit temples, go mountain climbing, or explore scenery.\nYet, perhaps no one in China travelled farther or longer than Xu Xiake. At least, if anyone did they did not write about it.\nWhen our raft reaches Ox Gorge, it proves to be every bit as beautiful as I expected—a watery heaven on earth. The raft is tied up, and then I head out to explore. That afternoon, I find a cave on the river. I wade into it and the water grows shallower, until finally I am walking on dry land. Up ahead I see a light and hear laughter echoing off the cave walls. There is a large pool of mud, and a group of young people are jumping into it and swimming around. I run and join them. Soon, like my new friends, I am covered in gray mud from head to toe. After an hour of play, I head back out of the cave and take a swim in the river to get clean. And I wonder, when Xu Xiake came here nearly five hundred years ago, did he examine the mud like a scientist? Or did he jump in?\nOf course he jumped in. You know he did.",
  "rjbgz133da3c0": "We watched as Shackleton and the boat sailed away from Elephant Island. It was easy to imagine the danger ahead of them. Would they ever return to find us? What might happen to them? What if they were delayed? We felt so alone and desperate. But it was not for long. There was nothing like a good dinner and some music to cheer us up.\nLife fell into a regular pattern. Staying alive took all our time and energy. For example, we needed water, and Elephant Island had none. We found that we could melt ice from the ocean and drink the water from it. But how could we make fire? There were no trees growing on Antarctica and no oil, so the only fuel we could use was animal fat. This gave off oily, black smoke, but it stayed burning even in strong winds.\nFood was also a problem, as we did not find any vegetables or fruit on the island. One of our group members, Lionel Greenstreet, noted in his diary about how bored he was with the meals: “The food now is pretty well all meat of sea creatures.” If it weren’t for sea animals, we would all starve. As a chef, it was my duty to cook, so I tried to vary the meals in whatever way I could. But it was difficult.\nWe had to be careful not to go outside too often, as the changing temperatures could make us ill. It was almost as dangerous to become too hot from wearing too many clothes as to become too cold from wearing too few. The sweat could freeze very quickly. Many of us also became ill from the black smoke of the animal fat we burnt for our fires. It damaged our eyes and burnt our lungs.\nThe twenty-two of us lived like this in the cold for four months. Our discipline and team spirit kept us optimistic and helped us deal with our fears in a positive and successful way. We also celebrated our birthdays, festivals, and even the times when we caught a sea animal. This was an episode in my life that I would never forget.\nWhen we were finally rescued, we felt such relief and joy that many of us could not hide our tears. We were at last free to go home to warm beds, good food, and the care of our family and friends. Our optimism and faith in Shackleton had helped us persevere in staying alive. And he paid us back by his commitment to save us from a slow but painful death.",
  "rjbgz1356d831": "What is Western art? It is hard to give a precise definition. As there have been so many different styles of Western art, it is impossible to describe them all in a short text. Perhaps the best way to understand Western art is to look at the development of Western painting over the centuries.\n## The Middle Ages (from the 5th to the 15th century)\nDuring the Middle Ages, the purpose of Western art was to teach people about Christianity. Thus, artists were not interested in painting realistic scenes. Their works were often primitive and two-dimensional, and the main characters were often made much larger than everyone else to show their importance. This began to change in the 13th century with Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). While his paintings still had religious themes, they showed real people in a real environment. In particular, his paintings are set apart from other paintings by their realistic human faces and deep emotional impact.\n## The Renaissance (from the 14th to the 17th century)\nNew ideas and values gradually replaced old ones from the Middle Ages. As a result, painters concentrated less on religious themes. They began to adopt a more humanistic attitude to life. An important breakthrough during this period was the use of perspective by Masaccio (1401–1428). Influential painters such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Michelangelo (1475–1564), and Raphael (1483–1520) built upon Giotto and Masaccio’s innovations to produce some of the greatest art that Europe had ever seen.\nAnother innovation was the use of oil paints. With their deep colours and realism, some of the best oil paintings look like photographs. While painters as early as Da Vinci had used oil, this technique reached its height with Rembrandt (1606–1669), who gained a reputation as a master of shadow and light.\nIn subject matter, the emphasis increasingly shifted from religious themes to people and the world around us. Kings, nobles, and people of high rank wanted to purchase accurate pictures of themselves and the people they loved. Others wanted paintings showing important historical events or stories from mythology. Finally, most clients wanted paintings that were beautiful and interesting to look at.\n## Impressionism (late 19th to early 20th century)\nThe development of Western art slowed until the invention of photography in the mid-19th century. After that, paintings were no longer needed to preserve what people and the world looked like. Hence, painters had to find a new way of looking at their art. From this, Impressionism emerged in France. The name of this new movement came from the painting by Claude Monet (1840–1926) called Impression, Sunrise. In this work, Monet’s aim was to convey the light and movement in the scene—the subjective impression the scene gave him—but not a detailed record of the scene itself.\nWhile many Impressionists painted scenes of nature or daily life, others, such as Renoir (1841– 1919), focused on people. Unlike the cold, black-and-white photographs of that time period, Renoir’s paintings are full of light, shadow, colour, and life. He sought to show not just the outer image of his subjects, but their inner warmth and humanity as well.\n## Modern Art (from the 20th century to today)\nAfter Impressionism, subsequent artists began to ask, “What do we do next?” Painters such as Picasso (1881–1973) tried to analyse the shapes which existed in the natural world but in a new way, with Cubism. Others gave their paintings a realistic but dream-like quality. Still others turned to abstract art. What they attempted to do was no longer show reality, but instead to ask the question, “What is art?”",
  "rjbgz13608021": "The Richfield Museum of Fine Art is proud to present our new exhibition, “From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages.” Join us as we explore more than 3,000 years of wonderful art from the Middle Kingdom. From bronze bowls to ceramic vases, and jade sculptures to ink wash paintings, our goal is to display the Chinese artistic genius from ancient times.\nThe highlight of this exhibition is the painting Clearing After Snow on a Mountain Pass, one of the great works of Tang Yin (1470–1524). Born during the Ming Dynasty, Tang sought and failed to gain entry into the civil service, so he turned to painting instead. In time, he gained recognition as one of the greatest artists China has ever known. This painting, showing high mountains, trees, and houses covered in snow, was made with extraordinary skill. Though it is over 500 years old, it looks as fresh and full of life as the day it was created.\nAlso of primary note is a collection of nearly 100 bronze objects from the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE–1046 BCE). While the artists who made these great works are not known, they showed great skill in creating these beautiful pieces. Some of the items on display are thought to have come from the collection of Emperor Qianlong (1711–1799), a great admirer of Shang Dynasty bronze.\nFinally, we have many fine examples of Tang Dynasty (618–907) sculptures. Most of these are of Buddhist origin. Even though Buddhism entered China much earlier, it did not really begin to show expansion until the seventh century. During this same period, trade along the Silk Road also boomed. Chinese sculpture thus found itself highly influenced by Buddhist art brought from India and Central Asia through the Silk Road. These works were intended to spread Buddhism and they are of exceptional beauty and quality. Looking at the faces of the figures in these sculptures, one sees the faces of the past. History is brought to life.\nThis is just a small taste of what is in store for you in this exhibition. We guarantee that “From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages” will transport you to another time with its amazing collection of works.\n“From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages” will run until November 25.\nOpening hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., from Tuesday to Sunday (the museum is closed on Mondays). No one will be admitted into the exhibition after 4:30 p.m.\nAdmission: $10 for adults; $8 for students; $5 for children under 12; free for children under 5.\nNo photos or food and drink are allowed in the museum.",
  "rjbgz136e35d8": "As teenagers grow up, they become more independent and start making their own decisions. However, during this period, it can be easy for some of them to form bad habits. These bad habits, if left unchecked, could lead to more serious ones when they become adults. For example, some of them may become involved in tobacco or alcohol abuse, which can lead to physical and mental health problems. To prevent harmful habits like these from dominating a teenager’s life is essential. They must learn to recognise bad habits early and make appropriate changes.\nTo change bad habits is never easy, even with many attempts. There is a famous saying based on the philosophy of Aristotle: “We are what we repeatedly do.” In many ways, our lifestyle is the sum of choices we have made. We make a choice to do something, and then we repeat it over and over again. Soon that choice becomes automatic and forms a habit that is much harder to change. The good news is that we can change, if we understand how habits work.\nAccording to modern psychology, we must first learn about the “habit cycle”, which works like this:\n• Firstly, there is a “cue”, an action, event, or situation that acts as a signal to do something.\n• Secondly, there is a “routine”, the regular action you take in response to the cue.\n• Thirdly, there is the “reward”, the good thing or feeling we get from the routine.\nFor example, when we feel unhappy (cue), we eat lots of unhealthy snacks (routine), which makes us feel happy (reward). The reward makes us much more likely to continue the cycle, and the bad habit of relying on unhealthy snacks is formed.\nTo facilitate a positive change in our bad habits, we must first examine our bad habit cycles and then try to adapt them. We can do this by combining the information from our habit cycles with our own positive ideas. For example, we could try to replace a negative routine with something more positive. So, when we feel unhappy again (cue), rather than eat snacks, we could listen to some of our favourite music instead (routine), which will make us feel relaxed (reward). Aside from changing bad habits, we can also use the habit cycle to create good habits. For example, when we come to an escalator (cue), our normal routine is to ride it, but we could change this routine into something more positive by taking the stairs instead.\nMany of us try to change bad habits quickly, and if we are not successful straight away, we often become pessimistic and give up. In fact, the most successful way to change is not suddenly, but over a period of time. As the Chinese philosopher Laozi wrote, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” One step seems small, but it is essential. To reach the goal of change, a person must show some discipline and repeatedly take many small steps. After all, it is not easy to break bad habits.\nFor young people, there is plenty of time to change bad habits. However, there is no “magic pill” or delete button that will help you; you have to think about your bad habits and decide on some changes. You have the power to build a happy and healthy life full of good habits!",
  "rjbgz1372f928": "We have known about climate change for decades. There is little doubt that Earth is getting warmer and warmer (see the graph). A warming ocean and atmosphere along with melting ice and rising sea levels provide evidence of a dramatic change in the global climate.\nIn 2013, a lot of people were shocked by a news photo of a dead polar bear that was found on Norway’s Arctic island of Svalbard. According to the scientists who found its dead body, all that remained of the polar bear was “skin and bones”. An expert who has studied polar bears for many years said that from the position of its dead body, the bear appeared to have starved and died. Experts claimed that low sea-ice levels caused by climate change meant the bear could not hunt seals as before, so it had to travel greater distances in order to find food. This alarming case showed how the increase in temperature had an impact on Earth’s ecology.\nThen what is causing the increase in the global average surface temperature? Climate scientists often mention a key climate process called the “greenhouse effect”, which has two common meanings: the “natural” greenhouse effect and the “man-made” greenhouse effect. The “natural” greenhouse effect refers to the fact that heat from the sun enters the atmosphere and warms Earth’s surface as short-wave radiation. The heat is released back into space at longer wave lengths. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as methane and carbon dioxide, trap some of the heat, keeping Earth’s climate warm and habitable. Without this process, Earth could not sustain life. However, the “man-made” greenhouse effect has now become a big problem. When people produce huge amounts of extra greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels, more heat energy is trapped in the atmosphere and causes Earth’s surface temperature to rise quickly.\nThere is strong and comprehensive evidence that the rise in temperature has led to an increase in extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide, not only causing serious damage, but also costing human lives. Climate scientists have warned that if we do not take appropriate actions, this warming trend will probably continue and there will be a higher price to pay. In fact, news reports are frequently broadcast about extreme rainstorms and heatwaves causing deaths and economic losses.\nContinued greenhouse gas emissions will result in further warming and long-lasting changes to the global climate. This requires the attention of people all over the world. Governments need to consider making policies and taking appropriate actions and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We as individuals can also reduce our “carbon footprint” by restricting the amount of carbon dioxide our lifestyles produce. It is our responsibility to seize every opportunity to educate everyone about global warming, along with its causes and impacts, because this is the most serious issue affecting all of us on this planet. So what will you do to help?\n",
  "rjbgz13a6b0da": "Perce Blackborow joined an expedition with Sir Ernest Shackleton to Antarctica on the ship Endurance in 1914. Shackleton was one of the most famous explorers of his day and it was considered a great honour to be part of his expeditions. Below are some of Blackborow’s diary entries.\n\n---\n31 Oct 1914\n... Well, it so happened that one morning I bought a newspaper and read the advertisement about the Antarctic expedition.\nAn expedition to the South Pole with the great Sir Ernest Shackleton—this is the adventure that I have been dreaming of. And I was ready for it. At the age of 19, I am fit and full of vigour. However, when I applied to join the expedition, Shackleton turned me down because he thought I was too young and wasn’t qualified. But I was so enthusiastic about the idea of going along with them that I secretly went aboard his ship, the Endurance , and hid in a small cupboard. Unfortunately, three days after we set off I was discovered. Shackleton did not want to turn back so he offered me a job, but only after he promised me, “If anyone has to be eaten, then you will be the first!” He assigned me to be a steward, and I now serve meals for twenty-eight men, three times a day.\nHow everyone will envy me when I come back and tell them about the amazing places I have been to!\n\n---\n21 Nov 1915\nThe journey has not been easy. Endurance became stuck in the ice as we approached Antarctica. The ice froze around us and we were well and truly stuck! We saw the ship get crushed by the ice. And when the ship sank, our hearts sank with it.\nBefore we abandoned the ship, Shackleton calmly called us together and told us to rescue our most essential supplies—the small boats, our food, the cook stove, candles, clothes, and blankets. This was no time to panic. We were not allowed to take most of our personal belongings, and Shackleton himself threw away all his gold. But to our surprise, he allowed Hussey to keep his banjo. Hussey often plays it to keep our spirits up.\nWe are now camped on the ice and we have been managing to survive, but spring is coming, and the ice will soon begin to melt.\n\n---\n20 May 1916\nWe have been struggling for days, but things on Elephant Island are going from bad to worse. We are now crowded together under one of our boats on the rocky shore of this miserable place. Soon after we arrived, Shackleton left us to find help on South Georgia Island, 1,320 kilometres away—the Ernest Shackleton voyage was too dangerous and difficult for all of us to make it in our small boats. If Shackleton fails, will we have any hope of rescue? No. No navy in the world ever stops at Elephant Island, and no one else knows that we are here.\nI feel low. It’s cold and windy. The island has no plants. Sometimes we are able to catch a seal or a penguin to eat. Otherwise, there is no food. I try to think of happier things: decent food, warm and dry clothes, a cosy bedroom, sunny days, and my mother’s face ... However, these happy memories are soon interrupted by a sudden cold rush of air.\nI shouted, “Shut the door!”\n“Hold on now, Perce. Don’t you go turning into another Tom,” came the reply. “We’ve caught another penguin, so it’s penguin soup tonight!”\nBless Frank Wild, the kindest man there is after our leader, Ernest Shackleton. How could I become as selfish and bad-tempered as Thomas Orde-Lees!\nWithout Frank and Ernest, we’d all be dead by now. Their genuine concern for others, their perseverance, and their resolve fill me with hope.\nPerhaps there is a chance we will return home, after all.",
  "rjbgz13a7a218": "## letter 1\nDear Editor,\nAfter I attended your summer camp about health and lifestyle choices, I realised I hardly ever felt well, either physically or mentally. I often felt sleepy and dizzy, and lacked passion. Most worrying, though, I got the flu easily and experienced many toothaches, too.\nAt the end of the camp I heard, “Change the world by changing yourself.” This stimulated my motivation. A dentist once examined me and told me that too much sugar in my meals had damaged my teeth and health. I made up my mind to change two things in my life: to eat nothing with sugar and to exercise regularly.\nAfter that I stopped buying all the sweets, biscuits, and sugary drinks that I used to have every day. Whenever I went out with friends, I brought snacks from home, things that didn’t have any added sugar: fruit, nuts, dried meat, etc.\nMy exercise was very simple: I went outside every day for at least 30 minutes and did something active. Sometimes I played table tennis or badminton with my cousins. Other times I jumped on my skateboard and rode around my neighbourhood, or just took a long walk.\nThe results have been fantastic. I feel more dynamic and stronger than ever, in both body and mind. I sleep soundly at night now. I no longer suffer from a flu virus or toothaches either. Best of all, in my opinion, is how I feel about myself. I feel like I’m in control of my own life. To make choices about myself is within my own power. I CAN change myself. I just need to try.\nYours truly,\nWang Lu\n## letter 2\nDear Editor,\nAs I took part in the summer camp about personal life choices, I started to analyse my choices, especially what I did to relax and how it was affecting my whole life.\nAfter starting high school, I felt stressed out and always relaxed by playing computer games. I got so absorbed that I played the games day and night. Playing was fun, but I felt even more worn out afterwards! So after the camp, I realised that it was very, very important to adjust my lifestyle. I decided to take control of my life and find other ways to relax.\nIt was a big struggle not to join my friends in playing online games as I’m mad for them. However, I realised that to succeed in quitting, I had to replace it with something else. So I thought about what to try. Rock climbing, bowling, watching comedies, and playing basketball were the things I thought of doing instead.\nNow my dad and I go rock climbing together monthly! It has enhanced the quality of my life, improving my health and increasing my happiness. I get refreshed through climbing, spend more time with my dad, and get to meet new friends.\nAfter six months of trying out new ways of relaxing, I feel much more energetic. I feel that I can change myself for the better. And if that’s true for me, then it might truly be possible to change the world for the better. As Gandhi said, “Be the change you want to see in the world.”\nSincerely,\nGeorge Fielding",
  "rjbgz13b4c418": "There are various reasons why people compose poetry. Some poems tell a story or describe a certain image in the reader’s mind. Others try to convey certain feelings such as joy and sorrow. The distinctive characteristics of poetry often include economical use of words, descriptive and vivid language, integrated imagery, literary devices such as similes and metaphors, and arrangement of words, lines, rhymes, and rhythm. Poets use many different forms of poetry to express themselves. Now we will look at a few of the simpler forms.\nSome of the first poems a young child learns in English are nursery rhymes. They are usually the traditional poems or folk songs. The language of these rhymes, like Poem A, is to the point but has a storyline. Many children enjoy nursery rhymes because they rhyme, have a strong rhythm, and often repeat the same words. The poems may not make sense and even seem contradictory, but they are easy to learn and recite. By playing with the words in nursery rhymes, children learn about language.\nOne of the simplest kinds of poem is the “list poem”, which contains a list of things, people, ideas, or descriptions that develop a particular theme. List poems have a flexible line length and repeated phrases which give both a pattern and a rhythm to the poem. Some rhyme, while others do not.\nAnother simple form of poem that amateurs can easily write is the cinquain , which is made up of five lines. With these, you can convey a strong picture or a certain mood in just a few words. Look at the example.\nHaiku is a Japanese form of poetry that consists of 17 syllables. It has a format of three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively. It is not a traditional form of English poetry, but is very popular with English writers. It is easy to write and, like the cinquain , can give a clear picture and create a special feeling using very few words. The haiku poem on the right is a translation from Japanese, which shows a moment in the life of a delicate butterfly.\nEnglish speakers also enjoy poems from China, those from the Tang Dynasty in particular. A lot of Tang poetry has been translated into English, such as this one.\nWith so many different forms of poetry to choose from, you may eventually want to write poems of your own. Give it a try!\n",
  "rjbgz13b62464": "The beautiful Li River and its amazing surrounding scenery is one of the most well-known tourist destinations in China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It attracts millions of domestic and foreign visitors each year. However, its reputation as a top destination has had negative effects on the river’s water quality. This report looks at the problem of water pollution and some actions that have been taken to deal with it.\nPreviously, water quality in the Li River had suffered greatly from an increasing volume of tourists, many of whom frequently threw garbage into the river. Many tour boats contributed to the problem too. Kitchens on board were using lots of oil, which was often thrown into the water. The growth in tourism also meant the local population rose rapidly, as well as the number of commercial and industrial enterprises. Water pollution levels increased, with more household and commercial waste ending up in the river. In order to feed more people, more chemicals were used to increase crop production. These chemicals led to severe water quality issues, causing a decrease in the number of fish species. Local officials were concerned that the pollution was damaging the natural environment and felt that urgent steps should be taken to restore the river’s original beauty.\nA comprehensive initiative was started, with a number of measures that addressed the issues. The construction of waste water treatment facilities improved the water quality and water conservation. The collection and transport of household waste was also improved. Dozens of polluting enterprises were closed or moved. The local government set up strict regulations regarding further industrial development. New rules were also introduced regarding tour boat routes and garbage disposal methods. Furthermore, the local authorities began to use the media to spread environmental awareness and encourage greater use of clean energy. At the same time, they started to carry out inspections regularly and fine tourist organisations for abuses. With these measures, it is believed that the beauty of the Li River will be preserved for generations to come.\nIn addition, the ambitious “Water Ten Plan” is also now tackling water pollution across the country. Other initiatives, such as the “River Chief System”, hold senior officials responsible for reducing water pollution. With such campaigns in effect, China’s waterways are heading towards a clean and sustainable future.",
  "rjbgz144319a3": "## Text 1\nWhen people talk of exploring the sea more, they usually mean exploiting it. Sea exploration has caused many problems and will continue to cause more.\nMore exploration means more pollution. The Deepwater Horizon spilled over 200 million gallons of oil into the sea in 2010. Plastic pollution is also bad, killing many birds and fish, and has even been found in our tap water.\nMining for resources is very damaging, especially in the Arctic. Because of climate change, there is less ice now, which means we can look for more fossil fuels further north. But if we burn these, the ice will melt more and this negative cycle will continue. Climate change is warning us that something is very wrong.\nOverfishing is another problem. Whales and dolphins are also hunted for their meat or for so-called research. Although this was banned in 1982, some countries are still “murdering” these intelligent creatures without mercy.\nThe sea is home to life, not human beings’ possessions. It is huge, but it is more sensitive than we think. If we do not protect it, future generations will not forgive us.\n## Text 2\nTo truly understand our planet, we must explore the oceans which cover most of it. Opponents may be concerned, but sea exploration is important for our future. For example, scientific research ships can help address important issues such as climate change. We need to understand what is happening to our planet so that we can take action. Therefore, more research is necessary.\nUnderstanding more about the sea will also help us manage its resources better. Logging new species will improve our understanding of life on the earth. It may help us discover new medicines, as well as new sources of food and energy. Accessing the deep ocean may also help us to predict events such as earthquakes.\nThe population of the world is growing and we need new resources for future development. There are probably vast amounts of resources under the sea and ice, not just oil and gas but also valuable minerals.\nOf course, there are still environmental risks. However, these should be balanced with economic needs. Hopefully, as technology improves, we may have more options for managing this balance.",

I plan to keep this blog to record my experiences and what I learn. I have already done some research on the country. Located to the south of the equator, below many other countries on the globe, it’s often informally referred to as “down under”.\nI have also read about some iconic sites, such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Ocean Road, and animals like the cute koalas and kangaroos.

Since I arrived, my friend has brought me to my first open-air barbecue and has also shared many different but yummy meals with me, so my first impressions of Australia have been all about food! A lot of typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast, is originally British. Bakeries, fast-food joints, butcher shops, cafes, and restaurants everywhere provide some of the premier food experiences in the world. The influence of Asian cultures, on the other hand, led to the introduction of bean curd and Asian herbs, along with Australian dim sim versions of foods like the Chinese-inspired dim sim.\n## Aborigines and the didgeridoo\n3 Oct\nMy friend and I have arrived in Katherine, a town in Australia’s Northern Territory. We’re here to learn about the life and customs of the Aborigines, who are native to Australia. The Aboriginal population might be small, but its influence is still visible. For example, “Bondi” in “Bondi Beach” is an Aboriginal word meaning “water breaking over rocks”.\nTo survive in this vast land on the ocean, the Aborigines had to be in close contact with nature. This shows in their music, too, which celebrates the natural world and the spiritual world around them. Most of their musical instruments are really just sticks found on the ground, among which there is an amazing instrument called the didgeridoo.\nThe didgeridoo is made from a tree branch which is hollow. To play the didgeridoo, you put your mouth on one end and blow while vibrating your lips. Unlike a horn, there are no finger holes. The didgeridoo player has to change the shape of his mouth in order to change pitch. A skilled player can play for a long time without stopping to breathe. He does this by continually breathing in through his nose while breathing out through his mouth and into the didgeridoo. I tried to learn how to play it, but after trying for hours, I was convinced that I could never make a musical sound with this instrument!\n## Reflections on multiculturalism\n6 Oct\nIt’s almost time for me to say goodbye to Australia. I’ve enjoyed my time here very much. After being here for a while, my biggest impression is the complicated mix of peoples and cultures that make up the nation. Although the main cultural influence since 1788 has been Western culture, minority cultures have also played a part in shaping the unique Australian culture, with many of the new cultural influences contributed by immigrants. It is said that now nearly half of all Australian citizens were either born overseas or have parents who were born overseas.\nPersonally speaking, what I like most about Australia is the people themselves. They have a straightforward and free-and-easy attitude towards life, and their friendliness and warmth made me feel at home wherever I went.\nAfter experiencing Australia, I have to say that I agree with the tourism slogan: “There’s nothing like Australia.”\n ",
  "rjbgz147adc70": "Hello! My name is Zhan Bingbing.\nLately, all of us have seen Chinese people on TV in far-off places in the world, helping other countries to develop. We see Chinese workers building roads in the Congo, a port in Pakistan, railways in Panama, and an airport in Sri Lanka. And we see Chinese miners, oil workers, agricultural experts, mechanics, and doctors working in nearly every corner of the world. And some people may ask, “Is it worth it? Why help people overseas when China has many areas that are still in need of development?”\nI had the same questions myself. But for me, it was much more personal. You see, my mother is a medical doctor, and for the last two years, she has been working as a volunteer consultant in Tanzania, Africa, as a part of a medical team sent by the Chinese government.\nTo be honest, when my mother first left for Africa, I was upset. My mother cooked me dinner every night, and she took good care of me. But more importantly, she was my best friend. We talked together, we spent our leisure time together, and except for school and work, we were never apart. So I was unhappy about her leaving without even asking for my input.\nBut then I began to hear about the work she was doing in Tanzania, a country that has many health problems, and now I am singing a different tune. Many dangerous diseases which are rare in China are quite commonly contracted in Tanzania. And, while the country is quite beautiful and has much natural wealth, many of the people are quite poor and live without things we take for granted, such as electricity, running water, cars and good transport systems, and supermarkets. One project that my mother worked on was helping to build a cardiac hospital. Prior to this, if a Tanzanian had a heart condition and needed surgery, they would have to go abroad. Since this was quite expensive, many people went without medical treatment and some even died. Now, not only are Tanzanians helped by the hospital, but people in neighbouring countries are helped as well. It has made a big difference to their lives. My mother also does a circuit of the rural villages to provide medical treatment, help those with disabilities, and provide consultation and training for local doctors. In addition, her team has given patients a new malaria treatment invented in China, and this has saved many lives.\nToday, I want to relay to you that I’m proud of the work my mother has done, and I am now supportive of it. Is her work worth it? Yes, to the lives of the people she is helping, it is worth it.\nBut by any criteria this work is worth it to us as well, because it shows that we are global citizens interested in world stability, and that we feel responsible for others and are ready to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Everyone deserves a fair chance in life. When I think of all the things that we as Chinese citizens can be most proud of, helping others comes at the top of this list. Now that I understand how important my mother’s work is, I’ve decided to become a volunteer myself to help people in other lands. In the future, I pray that you will do the same.\nThank you!",
  "rjbgz148354ee": "Our topic today is “Creatures Unique to Australia”, with questions answered by wildlife expert, Dr Jim Smith.\nAustralia has lots of unique animals, but which animal is a symbol of the country?\nIt has to be the kangaroo, as it has a wide distribution throughout the country. It’s a tough animal that has to survive in a difficult environment. Also, it cannot walk backwards, so it is always moving forwards. This expresses the strength and resolve of the Australians as individuals and as a nation. Baby kangaroos weigh only two grammes at birth. They then find their way into their mother’s pouch—a kind of pocket—to stay safe and warm. They sleep and drink milk in that temporary, protected environment until they are about seven or eight months old. After this phase, they go out to try their legs. After they learn to jump, they gradually spend less time with their mother and learn to be independent. Kangaroos may look cute, but encounters with them don’t always end so well. Kangaroos can hit and kick very hard, so please folks, if you see some kangaroos, remember they’re not for petting!\nKoalas are cute, and we see so many pictures of people holding them. But in many places in Australia, it is against the law to even touch them. Can you clarify that?\nThey are really quite cute, but the truth is, koalas are very sensitive creatures who can easily panic because of even small changes in their environment. They spend quite a lot of time eating, sleeping, and hanging onto tree trunks, so interaction with humans can cause them a lot of stress. Because of this, the government began to make laws against touching koalas, in the interest of animal protection, as well as public safety. So, if you see one in the wild, you shouldn’t approach it to pick it up or even touch it. If you want to hold a koala, you have to go to certain licensed zoos where animal experts make sure that the koalas selected for each session are in a good state for human contact and that they are handled for only a limited time and on a limited frequency of occasions. So, we’ve talked about some cute animals.\nWhat about animals which aren’t so cute?\nMy favourite is a little creature called the Tasmanian devil. If you are out camping in Tasmania and come across one, the experience might scare you! Tasmanian devils hunt at night, so you won’t usually see them, but you may hear their loud cries when they are fighting or eating. The noise they make could wake the dead. Frightening! They are about the size of small dogs and look like rather large black rats. They also have a terrible smell! Their diet is mostly dead animals. Fortunately, despite their name, they are generally not violent towards people.\nAustralia also has some animals that many people have never heard of, for example, the duck-billed platypus. Is that some kind of bird?\nNot at all. While it may lay eggs in a nest like a bird, it’s really a primitive mammal, with a unique biology. Its eggs hatch after about ten days, and then the baby platypus nurses from its mother like all other mammals. Its nose looks like a duck’s bill, and it has feet like a duck’s so it can dive under the water, but it’s covered in hair. Do you know what’s really strange about a platypus? The platypus doesn’t use its senses of sight or smell to find food. It has a capacity to find food in the water by using electrical sensors in its bill. There are only a small handful of animals in the world that can do that!",
  "rjbgz14aef45a": "It was at ten o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last check, and sat myself in the leather seat. I pushed the starting lever on the main panel forwards an inch then immediately backwards again. Looking around, I saw my laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? I thought my mind had tricked me. Then I saw the clock. A moment before, it was a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half past three!\nI drew a breath, gripped the lever and pushed it forwards. The laboratory went hazy around me. My niece came in to fetch something, maybe her handkerchief, apparently without seeing me. It probably took her a minute, but to me she moved like a rocket! I pushed the lever further. Night came as if a lamp was being turned out, and in another moment came the day. Tomorrow night came, then skipped to day, again and again, faster and faster still.\nIt is hard to explain the strange and unpleasant feeling of time travelling. It felt like I was being driven fast on a winding road. As my pace grew faster, the walls of the laboratory fell away, and I was left in the open air. The sun and moon looked as if they were being thrown across the sky, but soon there was division between night and day. Around me I saw trees growing like puffs of smoke; they grew, spread, and died in moments. I saw huge buildings rise up, then disappear like in a dream. The whole surface of the earth was being changed, melting and flowing before my eyes. I calculated that I was being pushed through time at hundreds of years a minute.\nI had a strong urge to look at the random things that were being flashed before my eyes! I had thought about the risk of stopping the Time Machine many times. So long as I travelled at maximum speed, it didn’t matter. But if I stopped and the same space was being occupied by something else, we would be forced together and explode like a bomb! Like an impatient fool, I pulled the lever backwards hard. With a sudden jolt, the Time Machine was flipped on its side, and I was thrown through the air.\nI was stunned for a moment, and then heard the sound of thunder. I was sitting in the rain in some mud next to the machine. “A fine welcome,” I said, “for a man who has travelled thousands of years to be here!”",
  "rjbgz14c2c557": "Larry Belmont worked for a company that made robots. Recently it had begun experimenting with a household robot. It was going to be tested out by Larry’s wife, Claire.\nClaire didn’t want the robot in her house, especially as her husband would be away on a business trip for three weeks, but Larry persuaded her that the robot wouldn’t harm her or allow her to be harmed. It would be a bonus. However, when she first saw the robot, she felt alarmed. His name was Tony. He seemed more like a human than a machine. He was tall and handsome with smooth hair and a deep voice, although his facial expression never changed.\nOn the second morning, Tony brought her breakfast and then asked her whether she needed help dressing. She felt embarrassed and quickly told him to go. Now she was being looked after by a robot that looked so human, and it was disturbing.\nOne day, Claire mentioned that she didn’t think she was clever. Tony said that she must feel very unhappy to say that. Claire thought it was ridiculous that she was being offered sympathy by a robot, but she gradually admired his wisdom and integrity and began to trust him. He always treated her with dignity. She told him how she was unhappy that her home wasn’t elegant enough for Larry, who wanted to improve his social position with a bigger salary. She wasn’t like Gladys Claffern, one of the richest and most powerful women around.\nAs a favour, Tony promised to help Claire make herself more beautiful and her home more elegant. So Claire borrowed some library books for him to read, or rather, scan. She looked at his fingers with wonder as they turned each page. How absurd, she thought. He was just a machine.\nTony gave Claire a new hairstyle and improved her makeup. As he was not allowed to accompany her to the shops, he wrote out a list of things that he would need for his work on the house. Claire went downtown and bought these things. She had an appointment to paint her nails, then she went into an expensive clothes shop. The saleswoman there was rude to her, so she rang Tony and told him she was being treated badly. He spoke to the woman, who immediately changed her attitude. Claire thanked Tony, telling him that he was a “dear”. As she turned around, there stood Gladys Claffern. How awful to be discovered by her, Claire thought. By the look on her face, Claire knew that Gladys thought they were in a relationship. After all, she knew Claire’s husband’s name was Larry, not Tony. Although it was completely innocent, Claire felt guilty.\nWhen Claire got home, she wept. Gladys was everything Claire wished to be. Tony told her she was being sensitive and was just as good as Gladys. He suggested that she invite Gladys and her friends to the house the night before he was to leave and Larry was to return. By that time, Tony expected that the house, which was being completely transformed, would be ready.\nTony worked steadily on the improvements. Claire tried to help by working on a light suspended from the ceiling, but she fell off the ladder. Even though Tony had been in the next room, he managed to catch her in time. As he held her, she felt the warmth of his body. She screamed, pushed him away, and ran to her room.\nThe night of the party arrived. The clock struck eight. The guests would be arriving soon, so Claire dismissed Tony for the rest of the night. At that moment, Tony took her in his arms, bringing his face close to hers. She heard him declare that he did not want to leave her the next day, and that he felt more than just the desire to please her. Then the front door bell rang.",
  "rjbgz14d16173": "As an adult, one of the first questions you are asked when meeting someone new is, “What do you do?”This is because your career is a very important part of who you are. The career you have defines your life, and so taking time to think about it is an essential exercise for young people.\nThe best time to start thinking about possible careers is while you are still at school, before you make any choices about your further education. This, however, is not always easy. Some people know what they want to do from a young age, but many others just have a few ideas bouncing around in their heads.\nOne of the most effective ways to get some insight on a possible career path is to complete a “career aptitude test”. The results of the test will tell you about your strengths and interests, and some tests also suggest careers that you may be suited to. Having this information will provide you with a better chance of finding a job you like. There are many free tests online, so give one a try. Getting a head start in considering your future career may help you for the rest of your life. You don’t want to look back in years to come and say, “I wish I had thought more about what I really wanted to do.”\nThere are many different kinds of career aptitude tests. Some ask questions about your personal interests and attitudes. Others focus more on asking you to rate different kinds of work scenarios, like working as a librarian or a lawyer. Of course, while completing these sorts of tests, it is very important to be honest—and don’t worry—there are no right or wrong answers.\nOne popular test asks the participants to grade their preferences for a variety of work tasks. Their answers are then analysed and divided up between six different types of work personalities. The participant is then given a chart showing their score for each type of work personality. The top three scores are used to make a code that indicates the participant’s overall work personality. This code is then used to generate a list of career suggestions.\nThe career suggestions are also based on your education and experience level, but you can look at higher-level careers as well, which is very useful for high school students. For example, you could look at the basic careers to see what work you might like now, and then look at the more advanced careers so you know what you may like to aim for in the future. This is a great tool to help plan your career and let you know what targets you need to reach to get there.\nIn conclusion, career aptitude tests are clearly a very useful tool. However, it is important to remember that they are only meant for guidance. The secret to a good career is finding something that you are passionate about. So try a few tests online and start thinking about your future career right now!",
  "rjbgz14d4687b": "Trade and curiosity have often formed the foundation of mankind’s greatest achievements. To complete the great map of the world was a strong passion for the people of early civilisations. Marco Polo’s tales inspired European explorers to search for sea routes from west to east. However, merchants and explorers from the East set sail from east to west many years before Columbus first did.\nIn ancient times, silk from China found its way overland to India, the Middle East, and Rome, along what became known as the Silk Road. A trading route across the sea was also extended along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, centred around Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Here, merchants from China and many other places met to negotiate trade deals, which also led to more awareness of each other’s cultures. Over the centuries, further trading allowed more exploration of the regions to the west of China, as recorded in Du Huan’s Record of My Travels in the eighth century.\nLater, the Ming Dynasty further developed relations with these regions. Between 1405 and 1433, seven large fleets sailed west on voyages of trade and exploration. These fleets were a sight to behold and were in a league of their own at that time. Under the command of Zheng He, they set sail from the South China Sea across the Indian Ocean to the mouth of the Red Sea, and then to the east coast of Africa. African royal families sent gifts such as giraffes as gestures of friendship in return for gold, silk, and spices. Although China withdrew from further expeditions after 1433, these land and sea routes remained active channels between other cultures for centuries.\nTo reach out across the sea remains a strong desire today. The ancient sea routes travelled by Zheng He are being revisited with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which is part of the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThe aim of this initiative is to encourage cooperation and trade across the historic Silk Road areas, and strengthen the bonds between China and the rest of the world. Trading has grown greatly in recent years, and will continue to do so in years to come. China has invested billions in systems and services along these routes, which will help to greatly develop the whole area for the benefit of future trade and cultural exchange.\nChina has also joined its friends across the sea on other important projects. Although the ancient sea routes of Zheng He have been travelled many times, there are still many other places left to explore. In recent years, China has joined other nations on several expeditions to explore the Arctic. From a scientific point of view, there is an urgent need to study the Arctic in order to understand climate change and its effects.\nHundreds of years on, and with the latest technology in hand, the need to trade and the desire to enhance relationships will drive China to reach out across the sea far into the future.",
  "rjbgz14eab47a": "8 March\nI just got a parcel from home! It took about two weeks to arrive, and it was a bit damaged, but it was so nice to get some sweets and jam from home; I’ve been dying to have some of my favourite sweets, and it’s always nice to get mail!\nSo I’ve been here in the jungle for about a month now. My secondary school is a bush school. The classrooms are made of bamboo, with clay floors and roofs of grass. It takes me only a few minutes to walk to school down a dusty track covered in weeds. When I reach the school grounds, I’m greeted by a chorus of “good morning” from the boys. Unlike students in our country, these boys do not wear cotton uniforms, and many of them also have to walk a long way, sometimes for up to two hours, just to get to school.\nThere’s no electricity, running water or even textbooks, not to mention laptops, tablets, or other modern devices! All the students have are pencils, rubbers, and paper. I’m still trying to adapt to these conditions. I’ve had to become much more imaginative in my teaching. Science is my most challenging subject as my students have no concept of doing experiments. There is no equipment, and since there isn’t even a washroom, if I need water I have to carry it from my house in a basin! It’s important not to be too rigid about rules here, too. The other day I was showing the boys a chemistry experiment when, before I knew it, the mixture was bubbling out of the test tube spilling everywhere! The class became a circus as the boys, who had never come across anything like this before, started jumping out of the windows. Sometimes I wonder how relevant chemistry is to these students—few will ever become chemists—and most will be going back to their villages after Year 8 anyway. To be honest, I doubt whether I’m making any difference to these boys’ lives at all.\n17 April\nLast weekend I made my first visit to a remote village, home to one of our students, Tombe. Another teacher and I walked for two and a half hours to get there—first, up a mountain from where we had fantastic views, and then down a shaded path to the valley below. When we arrived at the village, Tombe’s mother, Kiak, saw us coming and started crying “ieee ieee”. We shook hands with all the villagers. Everyone seemed to be related to Tombe.\nTombe’s father, Mukap, a man with a strong jaw and a wrinkled forehead, led us to his house, a low, round bamboo hut with no windows, with a door just big enough to get through, and with grass sticking out of the roof—this shows it is a man’s house. Such housing is dark inside so it took time for our eyes to adjust. Fresh grass had been laid on the floor and there was a platform for Jenny and me to sleep on. There was a fireplace in the centre of the hut. The only possessions I could see were one broom, a few saucers, a kettle, cups, pans, and a couple of jars.\nMukap built a fire outside and laid stones on it to heat. He then placed the hot stones in an empty oil drum with kau kau (sweet potato), ripe corn, and greens. He then covered the vegetables with banana leaves and left them to steam. It smelled delicious. We ate inside the hut sitting round the fire. I loved listening to the family talking softly to each other in their language, even though I could not participate much in the conversation. Luckily, Tombe interpreted for us.\nLater, I noticed a can standing upside down on the grill over the fire. After a while, Tombe threw it out of the doorway. Tombe told me that the can was heated to dry out the leftover food. His family believes that leftovers attract bad spirits in the night, so any leftover food is dried up in a can and the can is then thrown out of the hut.\nWe left the village the next morning after many goodbyes and firm handshakes. My muscles were aching and my knees shaking as we dragged ourselves down the mountain towards home. That evening I fell happily into bed. It was such a privilege to have spent a day with Tombe’s family.",
  "rjbgz2104b210": "(Adapted from Canyons of the Colorado by John Wesley Powell)\nThe Grand Canyon of the Colorado is a canyon composed of many canyons. It is a complex mix of thousands, of tens of thousands, of gorges. In a similar manner, each wall of the canyon is a wall composed of many walls. Every one of these gorges is a world of beauty in itself. Yet all these canyons unite to form one grand canyon, the most gorgeous spectacle on earth.\nThe carving of the Grand Canyon is the work of rains and rivers. When a shower comes in this land, the streams carve canyons-but a little at each storm; and though storms are far apart and the heavens above are cloudless for most of the days of the year, still, years are plenty in the ages, and an occasional stream called to life by a shower can do much work in centuries of centuries.\nIn winter some of the characteristics of the Grand Canyon are emphasised. The black rocks below, the varied quartzite , and the green sandstone form the foundation for the enormous red wall. The banded sand stone is crowned by the tower limestone. In winter this is covered with snow. Seen from below, these changing elements seem to graduate into the heavens, and no plane of separation between wall and blue sky can be seen. The heavens make up a part of the wall and form a vast dome from wall to wall, spanning the Grand Canyon with heavenly blue so that the earth and the heavens are blended in one vast structure.\nWhen the clouds play in the canyon, as they often do in the rainy season, another set of effects is produced. Clouds creep out of canyons and wind into other canyons. The heavens seem to be alive, not moving as the heavens move over a plain, in one direction with the wind, but following the multiplied courses of these gorges. In this manner the little clouds seem to be individualised, to have wills and souls of their own, and to be going on diverse jobs—a vast assembly of self-willed clouds, faring here and there, intent upon purposes hidden in their own breasts. In the imagination the clouds belong to the sky, and when they are in the canyon the skies come down into the gorges and cling to the cliffs and lift them up to vast heights, for the sky must still be far away. Thus they lend infinity to the walls.\nThe wonders of the Grand Canyon cannot be adequately represented by speech itself. The huge forms which result from the sculpture of storms through ages are formed into endless details. Besides the elements of form, there are elements of colour, for here the colours of the heavens are rivalled by the colours of the rocks. But form and colour are not all of the divine qualities of the Grand Canyon. It is the land of music. The river thunders in constant roar, swelling in floods of music when the storms play upon the rocks and fading away in soft whispers when the infinite blue of heaven is unveiled. With the melody of the great tide rising and falling, swelling and vanishing forever, other melodies are heard in the gorges of the side canyons, while the waters plunge in the rapids among the rocks or leap in great waterfalls. Thus the Grand Canyon is a land of song. Altogether it is a symphony of melodies.\nThe beauties of form, colour, and sound unite in the Grand Canyon—forms unrivalled even by the mountains, colours that contend with sunsets, and sounds that span the musical scale from storm to raindrop, from waterfall to bubbling fountain. Its colours, though many and complex at any instant, change with the rising and setting sun; lights and shadows appear and vanish with the passing clouds, and the changing seasons mark their passage in changing colours. You cannot see the Grand Canyon in one view, as if it were a changeless spectacle from which a curtain might be lifted, but to see it you have to strive from month to month through its gorges. It is a region more difficult to pass through than the Alps or the Himalayas. However, if you have enough strength and courage, after a year of work you will gain an understanding of the Grand Canyon’s magnificence, which can only be compared to the magnificence of paradise.\n",
  "rjbgz2108574d": "Wednesday, 3 May 1944\nDear Kitty,\n... As you can easily imagine we often ask ourselves here despairingly: “What, oh, what is the use of the war? Why can’t people live peacefully together? Why all this destruction?”\nThe question is very understandable, but no one has found a satisfactory answer to it so far. Yes, why do they manufacture still larger aircraft and still heavier bombs? Why should millions be spent daily on cannons and yet there’s not a penny available for medical services, artists, or for poor people?\nWhy do some people have to starve, while there are surpluses rotting in other parts of the world? Oh, why are people so crazy?\nI don’t believe that the big men, the politicians and the capitalists alone, are guilty of this warfare. Oh no, the little man is just as guilty, otherwise the people of the world would have risen in revolt long ago! In people, there’s simply an urge to destroy, an urge to kill, to murder and rage, and until all mankind, without exception, undergoes a great change, wars will be waged, everything that has been built up, cultivated, and grown will be destroyed and disfigured, after which mankind will have to begin all over again.\nI have often been downcast, but never in despair; I regard our hiding as a dangerous adventure, romantic and interesting at the same time. In my diary I treat all the hardships as amusing. I have made up my mind now to lead a different life from other girls and, later on, different from ordinary housewives. What I’m experiencing here is a good beginning to an interesting life, and that is the sole reason why I have to laugh at the humorous side of the most dangerous moments.\nI am young and I possess many hidden qualities; I am young and strong and am living a great adventure; I am still in the midst of it and can’t mutter the whole day long. I have been given a lot: a happy nature, a great deal of cheerfulness and strength. Every day I feel that I am developing inwardly, that the liberation is drawing nearer and how beautiful nature is, how good the people are about me, how interesting this adventure is! Why, then, should I be in despair?\nYours,\nAnne\n\n\n---\n\nThursday, 15 June 1944\nDear Kitty,\nI wonder if it’s because I haven’t been able to poke my nose outdoors for so long that I’ve grown so obsessive about everything to do with nature. I can well remember that there was a time when a deep blue sky, the song of the birds, moonlight and flowers could never have kept me spellbound. That’s changed since I’ve been here.\nAt Whitsun, for instance, when it was so warm, I stayed awake on purpose until half past eleven one evening in order to gaze at the moon for once by myself. Alas, the sacrifice was all in vain, as the moon gave far too much light and I couldn’t risk opening a window. Another time, some months ago, I happened to be upstairs one evening when the window was open. I didn’t go downstairs until the window had to be shut. The dark, rainy evening, the gale, the moving clouds held me entirely in their power; it was the first time in a year and a half that I’d seen the night face to face. After that evening my longing to see it again was greater than my fear of intruders, rats, and raids on the house. I went downstairs all by myself and looked outside through the windows in the kitchen and the private office. A lot of people are fond of nature, but few are so shut away and isolated from that which can be shared alike by rich and poor.\nIt’s not imagination on my part when I say that to look upwards at the sky, the clouds, the moon, and the stars makes me calm and patient. Mother Nature makes me humble and prepared to face every blow courageously.\nAlas, it has to be said that I am only able—except on a few rare occasions—to look at nature through dirty lace curtains hanging before very dusty windows. And it’s no delight looking through these any longer, because nature is just the one thing which there is no substitute.\nYours,\nAnne",
  "rjbgz211a001b": "Adapted from“Nature”by Ralph Waldo Emerson\nRalph Waldo Emerson(1803-1882), who was born and lived most of his life in Massachusetts, USA, was a famous poet and essayist.\n\nTo go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary while I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the eternal presence of magnificence. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the glory which had been shown! But every night come out these representatives of beauty, and light the universe with their smile.\nThe stars awaken a certain awe, because though always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a similar impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man obtain her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her perfection. Nature never became a toy fo a wise spirit. The flowers, the animals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had delighted the simplicity of his childhood.\nWhen we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by many different natural objects. It is this which distinguishes the log of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet.\nTo speak truly, few adults can see nature. Most people do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season brings delight; for every hour and change brings a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight. In good health, the air is a medicine of incredible virtue. Strolling across a bare common, in snow puddles at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect delight. I’m glad to the edge of fear.\nIn the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his skin, and at what period so ever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is eternal youth. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing bad can happen to me in life—no disgrace, no disaster, which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground—my head bathed by the happy air, and lifted up into infinite space—all of my shallow egotism fades away. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all.\nI am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something dearer than in streets or villages. In the peaceful landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man sees something as beautiful as his own nature.\nThe greatest delight which the fields and woods give me is the suggestion of a magical relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged. They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the branches in the storm is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.\nYet it is certain that the power to produce this delight does not exist in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For nature does not always wear holiday clothes, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume is filled with solemnity today. Nature always wears the colours of the spirit. To a man labouring under a burden, the heat of his own fire has sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.\n",
  "rjbgz213a38d1": "It is 1988, and the popular BBC TV programme That’s Life pans over its studio audience. The presenter then says casually, “Is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton? If so, could you stand up please?” At her request everyone in the first four rows stands up except for an elderly man and his wife. The man, Nicholas Winton, turns around in complete disbelief, before sitting back down, attempting to hold back the tears.\nThe story begins in 1938. Winton, a young stockbroker from London, went to Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) to see if he could help refugees—mainly Jews—escape the Nazi terror. Most had no real hope of getting out. But was it possible that their children might be able to slip away to safety? Yes, it was possible, provided foster parents could be found for them in England and a £50 bond was posted per child. Winton spent three weeks in Prague, interviewing parents, collecting names, and taking photos of children. He was then able to see off one small group of children. Finding foster parents and dealing with the British bureaucratic indifference seemed an almost impossible problem, however, he returned to London with a list of names in hand.\nBack home, he ran newspaper ads looking for homes for the children, coordinated placement, and got transit permits. He even forged permits when he had to. That summer, eight groups, at least 669 children in all, made it to England with his help. Tragically, a ninth group of 250 children was scheduled to leave, but prevented by the Nazis. Without Winton’s help, nearly all of the 669 children would have become casualties of the Nazi horror. Indeed, such was Nazi brutality that only two of the children in the ninth group survived the war.\nWhen the Second World War began, Winton became an ambulance driver in France and was rescued at Dunkirk. He then joined the British Royal Air Force (RAF). After the war, he quietly engaged himself in charitable activities. His accomplishment in saving those children from near certain death was forgotten, until his wife found a book in his attic with the names of hundreds of children, and asked That’s Life to help her track them down. The episode of the programme which resulted was widely viewed as one of the most moving ever broadcasted, and instantly made Winton a household name. Winton died, honoured and revered, in 2015 at the age of 106.\nOf all the lesser known Schindlers who helped Jews escape the Nazi terror, one of the most obscure is Ho Feng-Shan. Born in Hunan Province, Ho became a diplomat for the Chinese government in 1935, and received a post representing China in Vienna, Austria in 1937. In 1938, Austria was occupied by Nazi Germany, and so the office in Vienna became a Chinese consulate for Germany. Shortly afterwards, an international conference was held in Evian-les-Bains, France with the hope of opening the doors for Jewish refugees to leave Germany. Instead, the conference had the opposite effect—no agreement was reached and most of the countries which attended refused to accept Jewish refugees. Then on the night of 9 November, the infamous Kristallnacht (Crystal Night) occurred, where ruthless Nazi paramilitaries terrorised the Jews, destroying Jewish businesses and sanctuaries. This triggered chaos as Jews sought to leave Germany. However, all the doors seemed shut.\nThere was one small hope for many Jews—Shanghai. In those days, as an international city, no visas or documents were needed to enter the municipality. The problem was that even though Shanghai did not require a visa, refugees needed to show that they had a valid destination visa to be eligible to leave Germany. In practice, once the refugees left Germany, they could immigrate to any place that would take them; they just wanted to leave Nazi Germany.\nHo had great sympathy for refugees who wanted to leave Germany. Consequently, he decided to give visas to whoever applied. It is not known how many Shanghai visas Ho issued. It is known that he issued nearly 2,000 of them by October 1938, and thousands more until he was transferred back to China in 1940. “It was just natural to feel compassion for those persecuted and help them. It was what had to be done,”Ho said later.\nHo continued to serve as a diplomat until he retired and went to live in San Francisco, in 1973, where he died in 1997. During his own lifetime, not only did Ho’s deeds go completely unrecognised, but even his own family was unaware of his efforts. However, after his death his daughter discovered the part he played in rescuing so many people, and decided to investigate. This has led to widespread international recognition of his heroism, and in 2000 the Israeli organisation Yad Vashem (The World Holocaust Remembrance Centre) honoured him as “Righteous Among the Nations”.\n",
  "rjbgz21598e95": "Welcome, everyone, to my seminar: “The Pursuit of Happiness”. Today, we’re going to examine the factors that can contribute towards our levels of happiness, and then I’m going to reveal to you all my special five-point plan to become a happier person. Great, so let’s begin!\nFirstly, how would you all define happiness? It’s simple, right? It can be conceived of as just a reflection of the pleasure and excitement that we all experience in life. But we could also say that it stems from our relationships with the people and things around us. And some people might also say that happiness can manifest itself through our faith or beliefs.\nLet’s take a look at what studies on happiness can tell us. We usually become happier as we age, although I must confess this hasn’t happened to me yet! And for every one of us here, family and social relationships are important to our happiness levels. Now, who’s married here? Studies suggest that being married makes us happier than being single, divorced, or widowed. That’s because being married and having kids is the key to happiness, right? Well, as for parenthood, it doesn’t necessarily increase happiness. Some studies actually show a higher level of happiness among people without children. Similarly, many of us presume that attractive people lead a really happy life, but in reality, our looks only have a slight effect on how happy we feel. Actually, concentrating on our inside and maintaining a positive attitude is a much more proven way to boost our happiness, which in turn improves our study and work performance. Now let me ask you all a question: How many of you believe that money can buy happiness? Raise your hands, please... Well, interestingly, studies show that money, to an extent, can indeed influence happiness. Generally speaking, at both individual and country level, we’re happier when we’re rich than when we’re poor. In fact, some say our income correlates directly with our happiness, meaning we get happier as our salary increases, which is something I think we can all relate to! However, there is a cut-off point for this effect. Once people start earning over a certain amount of money, they can begin to lose appreciation for the simple things in life that previously made them happy.\nOf course, not all of these factors will be relevant to all of us here. But luckily for us, modern psychology offers a theory that can apply to everyone regardless of their status: the “three elements of happiness”. Let’s take a look.\nThe first element of happiness is known as “the pleasant life”. It means enjoying everyday pleasures that add fun and positivity to our lives, like meeting with our friends or taking a nice walk. The second element is called “the good life”, which means using our skills to make our lives better. It’s like when we find work that uses our talents or interests, or we pursue a hobby that really satisfies us. The final element is “the meaningful life”—giving something of yourself to others or the world around you. For example, many of us might help our family and friends and maybe even our local community. Now that you know about the three elements, ask yourself, how much do they apply to you and your life? According to this theory, we will be the happiest when we incorporate a balance of all three elements into our lives.\n“So how can I use all this to make me happier?” I hear you ask. Well, I’d like to end with my five-point plan to happiness, which includes the three elements. If you follow these realistic steps, you will almost certainly increase your happiness levels. Everyone ready?\n● First, happiness is a frame of mind, so we must concentrate on the positive. Become accustomed to occasional problems and treat them as just a normal part of life. Learn to look on the bright side and filter out negative thoughts. By doing this, we’ll eventually find our general outlook changes for the better.\n● Secondly, commit to making ourselves and others happy. If we’re not happy with our current job, we should find work in a field that interests us, even if it means retraining. As the saying goes, do what you love! And when we help others, it makes us feel happy, and they’ll be more likely to help us in return.\n● Thirdly, build and cherish relationships. We may feel exhausted each night, but making new friends and keeping in touch with old ones will consequently lead to an increase in our happiness levels.\n● Fourthly, treat ourselves every now and then. However, we need to spend wisely—that means making sure our money is spent on special experiences rather than luxury goods. We should avoid impulse buying, skipping the fancy clothing in favour of a trip to the theatre—preferably with relatives or friends, as it will strengthen our relationship with them, further increasing our happiness in the process.\n● Last but not least, be content with what we’ve got, and live a little. We should not compare ourselves to others whatsoever. Instead, we must be happy in ourselves. And let’s always live for the moment; be spontaneous and do something unprecedented—it will make us feel much more alive.\nSo there you have it: my five tips to a happier life. Now, how about some spontaneous applause mark the end of my presentation? ... Thank you, everyone—stay happy!\n",
  "rjbgz21747c54": "Never had a situation been more desperate. On 26 May 1940, some 400,000 British and French soldiers were trapped at the town of Dunkirk on the north coast of France. Surrounding them were 800,000 German troops, including seven tank divisions. In lightning strikes, this same German army had already defeated the Dutch and Belgian armies and had destroyed most of France’s forces. Now it was getting ready to destroy the soldiers at Dunkirk.\nThe fighting had begun in earnest just 16 days before. Though war had been declared on 3 September 1939, for months if had been a “Phoney War”. France and Germany mobilised their militaries, and Britain sent a force to help defend France, but there had been very little shooting. Meanwhile, both Belgium and the Netherlands had declared neutrality—a neutrality Germany promised to honour. Little did they know what Germany had planned for them.\nOn 10 May, large numbers of German tanks and soldiers invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Resistance quickly fell and their countries surrendered.\nMeanwhile, the French and British fought back, leaving the French army’s right flank lightly protected. German tanks used this to their advantage. They struck the French in the east, destroying or capturing almost all the French forces in their path. Then they continued west to the English Channel, trapping much of the remaining French and British forces along the coast. Such was the speed and momentum of the German assault that they seemed undefeatable. Nobody imagined that the attack would be so fierce or so swift. The British army had been guarding the French left flank along the coast, so it was still intact. However, not only were the British and French fighters unable to mount much of a defence, but they had no hope of reinforcements. Worse yet, without these men, Britain had no way to protect itself from German invasion. The fate of a whole nation now lay in the balance.\nThen the miracle began.\nOn 26 May, the British navy began trying to rescue the men trapped at Dunkirk. However as the water near Dunkirk was quite shallow, there was no way to get large navy ships close to the shore to pick up the men. The British government quietly put out the word that small boats—“the Little Ships of Dunkirk”—were needed to help ferry the men to safety. No sooner had the word gone out than it began to spread like wildfire, and just about any kind of boat that could move under its own power—lifeboats, tugs, fishing boats, and yachts—joined vessels from the British navy to rescue the soldiers. Some of these ships were piloted by the civilians who owned them. They were not soldiers, but rather fishermen, lawyers, and doctors, amongst other professions. They wanted to help their country. Most had no weapons but their own brave hearts. All in all, including the Little Ships, there were more than 900 boats that came to help.\nThe scene at Dunkirk was terrifying: wrecked and burning ships everywhere, thousands of British soldiers standing deep in the water, holding their weapons over their heads, hundreds of thousands more in lines on the beaches. Through all the danger moved the little boats coming to the rescue.\nGerman planes came in to attack, raining down a hail of bombs and machine gun bullets, but the little boats continued to come and take aboard soldiers. Tired men staggering across the beach, fell into the little boats, while others died where they stood, among the bombs and bullets. Fortunately, the British Royal Air Force shot down more than a hundred German planes.\nThere was no panic. Seldom was there a mad rush for boats. The men moved slowly forward, neck deep in the water. As those in front were dragged aboard the boats, those in the rear moved up, until it was their turn to be pulled up over the side.\nBoats that had never carried more than a dozen people at a time were now carrying 60 or more. Somehow, they took their loads out to the larger ships waiting offshore and then returned to the beach to load more men. All through the long hours, the work went on. The crews kept pulling the men aboard, took them out to the larger ships, then returned for more. No matter how many times they made the trip, there were still more men waiting to be rescued.\nAnd then at long last, on the morning of 4 June, with the fires growing pale against the daylight and the dive-bombers sweeping in for the kill, the job was done; the beach was empty. Only then did the fleet turn and start home to England.\nIt had been hoped that some 30,000 men might be rescued, but 338,000 were saved, including most of the British army, and over 130,000 French troops. However, this was more than just the rescue of several hundred thousand men. These same British soldiers would go on to defend Britain, help free France from German occupation and then triumph over Nazi Germany. Had if not been for the miracle at Dunkirk, the war might well have been lost.\n",
  "rjbgz219e7f8a": "(Adapted from Gooseberries by Anton Pavlovich Chekhov)\nIvan, the veterinary surgeon, and Bourkin, the schoolmaster, were enjoying a refreshing walk in the countryside.\n“Last time when we met,” said Bourkin, “you were about to tell me a story.”\n“Yes, I meant to tell you about my brother.”\nJust as Ivan was about to start his story, the heavens opened, catching the two men completely by surprise.\n“We need to take shelter from this harsh weather,” said Bourkin, wiping the rain from his eyes. “Let us go to Aliokhin’s; it’s close by.”\nThe two companions quickly took a shortcut to where Aliokhin lived. In the doorway of the barn stood Aliokhin himself, a man of about forty, tall with long hair, more like a painter than a landowner. He grinned at his acquaintances with great enthusiasm.\n“Welcome, gentlemen!”he said, delighted to see them.“You look wet and weary! Go into the house. I’m just going to quickly bathe. I’ll be with you shortly.”\nThe two men were met by a maid, who had brought them some slippers. She then guided them to some armchairs in a big drawing room, which was enriched with countless bookcases and authentic paintings. Sometime later, Aliokhin appeared, his hair all neatly combed. The three men exchanged greetings and then Bourkin suggested that Ivan should tell his story. Ivan leant back in his chair and commenced his tale, and it seemed as though not only Bourkin and Aliokhin were listening but also the ladies and the officers in the paintings, who were all sternly looking down upon them from their golden frames.\n“My brother, Nicholai Ivanovitch, is two years younger than I. When we were boys, our father died, leaving us with a small estate. But after his death, the estate went to pay his debts. We spent our childhood in the countryside just like peasants’ children, playing in the fields, working in the mill, and so on ... But it was no life of misery. You know, once a man has lived in the country, to the day of his death, he will be drawn to the country.”\n“Anyway, at age 19, my brother began employment as a court clerk. Years passed by and he thought of only one thing: how to return to the country. He used to draw plans of his dream estate that would always have the same things on them: a farmhouse, a cottage, a vegetable garden, and a gooseberry bush. He clung to this dream and began to save every penny he could. He was so poor and hungry that he often looked like a beggar.”\n“30 years on, still with the same notion of buying a farmhouse with a gooseberry bush, he opted to marry an elderly widow—not out of any feeling for her but because she had money. Money, like vodka, can play strange tricks on a man. When his wife passed away, he used her funds to purchase his dream: three hundred acres of land, with a farmhouse, a cottage, and twenty gooseberry bushes.”\n“Last year, I paid a visit to his country paradise. I saw that my brother was no longer a poor, tired court clerk but a landowner and a person of apparent importance. He boasted,‘The people love me. I have only to raise my finger and they will do as I wish.’ And, like a good, noble landowner, he said he often performs acts of charity. On his last birthday, he treated the village peasants to half a bucket of vodka, after which they bowed to him in gratitude and licked his boots in disgusting drunkenness. I remember when he was a court clerk, he was terrified to have an opinion of his own, but now he imagines himself as an important lord with an opinion on everything. It seems as though he had forgotten that our grandfather was a peasant and our father a common soldier.”\n“I remember later that evening when my brother tried the first gooseberries ever grown on his estate, glancing at me in triumph. ‘How delicious!’ he exclaimed. So I tried one, and it was hard and sour. But, as Pushkin said,‘the illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths.’ I saw a happy man, one whose dream had come true, but it also filled me with a sense of deep despair. No one ever thinks of those who suffer and of all the horror that goes on in life. It appears that a happy man only feels so because the unhappy bear their burden in silence, and without that silence, happiness would be impossible. But life will sooner or later show its claws to those who are selfish. Some misfortune will come for them—illness, poverty, loss—and then no one will see or hear them, just as they now neither see nor hear others. I went away from my brother’s house early in the morning, and ever since then it has been unbearable for me to be in town.”\nIvan then walked over to Aliokhin and shook his hand firmly with both hands.\n“My dear friend! Don’t be satisfied; think of all those poor souls in need! While you are still young, strong, and wealthy, do not cease to do good! If our life has a meaning, an aim, it has nothing to do with our personal happiness, but something wiser and greater. My only regret in life is that I have got to this grand old age without even a thought for others. Oh, how I wish it weren’t so.”\nAnd all this Ivan said with a pitiful, imploring smile, as though he were asking Aliokhin a personal favour.\nThen all three were silent. Ivan’s story had satisfied neither Bourkinn or Aliokhin, who both would have rather heard of happier topics. But Aliokhin was pleased enough to have visitors that talked of things that had no direct bearing on his life. He did not think to question whether what Ivan had said was wise or true.\n“Alas, it is bedtime,” said Bourkin, getting up. “Allow me to wish you both goodnight.”\nThe three men then made their way to their separate rooms.\nIvan Ivanovitch uttered a sigh as he undressed in silence and got into bed.\nThe rain lashed against the windowpanes all night long.\n",
  "rjbgz21a47e72": "## Nature’s Properties Often Being Ignored\nWe often take nature for granted. Of course we know that it exists, because it is all around us. It is the water that we splash on our face in the mornings, the freshly cut grass we smell on our way to school, the apple we have for lunch, the golden rays of the setting sun which bathe our world with glory, and the stars which guide our nightly dreams. The breeze that gently touches you cheeks and the clouds that paint images in the sky are constant reminders of nature’s presence. However, it is so easy to become jaded with that which we know too well. And, just as we so often pass by the riot of colours in a garden, not noticing its fantastic beauty, we seldom stop to think that nature is endowed with an array of properties, which, if we had them, would be considered superpowers.\n\n## Stronger Than Steel\nOne popular superhero from a popular film is a teenager who shoots out a silken thread and uses it to fly through the air or catch criminals. While this may seem remarkable, spiders in nature do this all the time. One slender strand of spider silk is less than 1/20 the diameter of a human hair. However, if it were the same size as a steel beam, it would be five times stronger than the steel. It is also tremendously flexible, having the ability to stretch 2 to 4 times its length. This allows spiders to use their silk to spread out like an umbrella to fly through the air, and to weave webs which can catch large prey without breaking. How large a prey? The golden orb weaver spider in Australia is known to catch and eat small birds in its webs. It is also no accident that many webs look like works of art. Some spiders deliberately make them look more beautiful in order to attract insects. Since spider webs often lose their stickiness in a short time, spiders often make a new web, eating the old web to recycle the protein.\n\n## Magic Tree Roots\nOne of the most lovable superheroes in film is a tree-like alien who is able to grow back body parts and reproduce from branches. However, this superhero lacks one super attribute that all real trees have—roots. While typically trees have a root system that is about the size of their branches, up to 90% of some desert trees—such as the mesquite trees—are made up of roots, as they need long roots to find enough water to survive. However, the deepest roots belong to a wild fig tree in Ohrigstad, South Africa, which reach 120 metres underground. But what are roots’ superpowers? For one thing, they are strong enough to break apart rocks and concrete. Since they are constantly in search of water, if they find a crack in a stone, they will force their way into it and over time break it apart. For another, some tree roots appear to have telepathic powers and can use this to communicate with other trees about the weather and growing conditions. Through their roots, some trees even provide nutrients to other trees in their area which are struggling to survive.\n\n## The Powerful Oceans\nOne of the most powerful superheroes in film is a woman who can call forth instant hurricanes and even lightning bolts to overcome the bad guys. Her real-life prototype is the ocean. Much of the solar radiation striking Earth—more than 100 times the energy used by humans—is absorbed by oceans and circulated by currents around the globe, warming areas farther away from the solar radiation. Warmth from the oceans heats the air, causing it to rise and form wind. Warm ocean water also evaporates and turns into the moisture that forms clouds and rain; 85% to 90% of the rain on earth comes from ocean water. Thus, the vast majority of the earth’s storms, even those far away from the sea, are activated by the oceans’ great power. The most powerful storms by far are hurricanes, which are created on the ocean and then move over land. A typical hurricane releases the same energy as 10,000 nuclear bombs. The power of ocean is really beyond our imagination!\n\n## Knowing Our Proper Place\nOf course though nature has superpowers, it is not a superhero—it is not a person whom we can talk to and bargain with. Rather, it is a powerful force that holds us at its mercy. As much as we try to make use of nature and bend it to our will, we are the ones who must always adapt. In the same way that we must live our lives by the rhythms of the sun though the sun does not notice our existence, it is we who must order our lives by nature, and not the other way around. This should create in us both humility and awe. Nature is more powerful, mysterious, and beautiful than anything we ourselves could ever make with our own hands. Just as we cannot control the wind, we cannot create anything as beautiful as a simple rose, and there is so much about nature that is still beyond our comprehension. Since our own powers and abilities are so limited compared to the richness of nature, we would do well to appreciate it more, to stop and consider its greatness, to stand in a we of its complexity and magnificence.\n",
  "rjbgz21af5ae3": "(Adapted from The Conquest of Happiness by Bertrand Russell)\nI wish now to speak of the affection that a person gives. This also is of two different kinds, one of which is perhaps the most important expression of a zest for life, while the other is an expression of fear. The former seems to me wholly admirable, while the latter is at best a consolation. If you are sailing in a ship on a fine day along a beautiful coast, you admire the coast and feel pleasure in it. This pleasure is one derived entirely from looking outward and has nothing to do with any desperate need of your own. If, on the other hand, your ship is wrecked and you swim towards the coast, you acquire for it a new kind of love: It represents security against the waves, and its beauty or ugliness becomes an unimportant matter. The better sort of affection corresponds to the feeling of the man whose ship is secure, while the less excellent sort corresponds to that of the shipwrecked swimmer. The first kind of affection is only possible in so far as a man feels safe. The latter kind, on the contrary, is caused by the feeling of insecurity. The feeling caused by insecurity is very subjective and self-centred, since the loved person is valued for services rendered, not for intrinsic qualities. I do not, however, wish to suggest that this kind of affection has no legitimate part to play in life. In fact, almost all real affection contains something of both kinds in combination. Affection does really cure the sense of insecurity; it sets a person free to feel again that interest in the world that is obscured in moments of danger and fear. But despite all this, it is still no match for affection felt through security, because it depends upon fear, and it is more self-centred. In the best kind of affection, a person hopes for a new happiness rather than for escape from an old unhappiness.\nThe best type of affection is mutually life-giving. Each person receives affection with joy and gives it without effort, and each finds the whole world more interesting in consequence of the existence of this mutual happiness. However, there is another kind of affection that is commonly seen in life, in which one person sucks the vitality of the other. One receives what the other gives, but gives almost nothing in return. Some very vital people belong to this bloodsucking type. They extract the vitality from one victim after another, but while they prosper and grow interesting, the victims grow pale and dim and dull. Such people use others as a means to their own ends and never consider them as ends in themselves. Fundamentally, they are not interested in those whom for the moment they think they love; they are interested only in the stimulus they get from the relationship. Evidently, this springs from some defect in their nature, but it is one not altogether easy either to diagnose or to cure. It is a characteristic frequently associated with great ambition and is rooted deeply. It is, in essence, a very one-sided view of human happiness. Affection in the sense of a genuine interest of two persons in each other, not solely as a means to each other’s good, but rather as a common good is one of the foremost elements of real happiness. The man whose ego is so enclosed within steel walls that he only thinks of himself misses the best that life has to offer however successful he may be in his career. Ambition which excludes affection from others is generally the result of some kind of anger or hatred against the human race, produced by unhappiness in youth, by injustices in later life, or by any of the cause which lead to persecution mania. A too powerful ego is a prison from which a man must escape if he is to enjoy the world to the full. A capacity for genuine affection is one of the marks of the man who has escaped from this prison of self. To receive affection is by no means enough. Affection which is received should liberate the affection which is to be given, and only where both exist in equal measure does affection achieve its best possibilities.\n\n",
  "rjbgz21ebe405": "The Parenting Monthly viewing recommendation this month comes in the form of a marvellous new play that is showing at the Paradise Theatre. It is an adaptation of a play from over a century ago, The Blue Bird, by Maurice Maeterlinck. We strongly recommend it for its imaginative storyline and underlying strong moral values. Here is a description of its main messages and features.\nThe story depicts a young brother and sister who live in a humble cottage with their hard-working parents. One night, the children enter a strange dream world, where they are visited by a fairy, who asks them to find the Blue Bird of Happiness. The fairy then turns their pets and various household objects into real people so they can escort the children on an adventure full of wonder, temptation, and magic.\nThe play presents itself as a typical children’s storybook adventure, with the added bonus that it teaches kids about the true meaning of happiness. For example, in the Land of Memory, the children encounter their beloved grandparents, who have already passed away, signalling heavily to the audience that we should all treasure the happy times spent with relatives.\nThe play also does a great job of showing how the kids realise they have an important task to complete and must resist all temptation. In the Palace of Happiness scene, many of life’s luxuries are personified for the children to see. Characters such as “The Luxury of Being Rich” and “The Luxury of Eating When You’re Not Hungry” all seem very attractive at first. However, upon using a magic hat, the children gradually begin to see their inherent flaws. Throughout their journey, the children are successful in finding several Blue Birds, but each time there is a complication. Naturally, the children become discouraged, prompting their mother to appear in the dream to comfort them. Eventually, the children return home and fall asleep. When they wake up, they find themselves in the real world again, showing a refound appreciation for their home, pets, and parents, stressing the old proverb of being happy with what you’ve got.\nThe play’s cast performed well throughout the show. The choice of actors, some of whom are quite well known in the theatre world, was very fulfilling. From start to finish, the actors’ teamwork and showmanship carried the audience on a convincing journey across the story’s magical land. The children’s performances were especially potent, their passion and comradeship reminding us how rewarding watching live performances can really be.\nThe play’s design elements were very well thought out and, just like the casting, showed no signs of idleness. It was a little disheartening to hear a small complication with the audio system during the first scene, but it was soon fixed and the play continued nonetheless. The stage design and props, although quite basic at times, were enough to set the scene. In addition, the characters’ costumes were quite creative and convincing, with clever use of makeup to bring out their features.\nThe overall reaction to the performance seemed very positive. For a century-old play, it was still very relevant to modern times. And, most importantly, it taught the kids how to appreciate the happiness that is right there under their little noses, undoubtedly making them return home that little bit happier.\n",
  "rjbgz21f3e7e4": "One afternoon, they were sitting on the seat that looks down into Govetts Leap—the great valley that the highest rocks of the mountains guard. The five girls were gazing out into the great stretches of mountains rolling back against the sky.\n“Oh, to see this place with the sun behind it!”cried Mabel, suddenly. “If we could only see the sun rise there beyond those great, dark rocks, and make all the sky turn red. By the time we get down here in the daytime it’s all uninteresting to look at.”\nAfter tea that night they told their mother that they wanted to see the sunrise at the Leap.\n“You will all be very careful?”\n“Of course we will.”\nAt that the mother gave her permission.\nSo that same night the billy was packed with tea, sugar, and a little bottle of milk. Mabel cut sandwiches and made them into a parcel.\nAt three the alarm went off, and in approximately a quarter of an hour everyone was dressed ready to go out.\nAs they opened the back door and stepped out into the yard, they all had little thrills of fear running up and down their nerves. They were soon down on the long red road that led to Govetts Leap.\nUp in the sky there were many stars, and from them came all the light that there was, except the lantern’s beams. Then some long, thin rays of light, just where the mountains touched the sky.\nOn either side of the road the bush was black and still. But from it there came stealing sweet, pure tree-scents and leaf odours—the scent of cherry-wood and of sharp grey gum trees.\nThen a pale, weak light crept out into the darkness, the trees in the bush around were not quite so black, and the road in front began to show faintly white. Turn after turn of the long red road went by. All the time the light was strengthening, and the lantern’s beam was paling.\nOne more turn, and the white fence at the head of the Leap came into view. They hurried on their cheeks blooming with the roses of health and early morning, and dropped their basket and the billy on the steps of the adjacent look-out shed.\nThen they seated themselves on the steps and watched. They were just in time.\nFirst, the sky beyond the Leap turned pale, pale pink. Then a sparkling zig-zag line of gold wrote itself right across the pink. It was like a flash of golden lightning come to stay.\nA great red ship came sailing into the pink and gold. After it, there floated a medieval castle. Seas and rivers and mountains rose from some mysterious place, and floated across the sky. The footsteps of the five rang clearly and evenly on the air.\nThen a small, bright, yellow thing, rising from behind a far-off peak. Slowly, and yet quickly, it went up into the sky.\nAll in a moment a flood of light burst out over the eastern mountains, the yellow thing was round and brilliant, the sky was one sea of red. The eyes that watched were blinded, and looked down a minute; and the sun had risen.\nThe Leap was no longer the dull, grave Leap of the noon and afternoon. The light was pouring down through it, and its mists were glowing with old gold and rose and tender orange and kingly purple.\nOn the mountain sides the leaves of the trees were gleaming like diamonds. Over the rocks rolled the water in a fall of jewels. The rocks themselves stood out against a blazing red background. A change, more wonderful even than the sunset’s, had over swept the world.\nThe five little girls sat on the steps, and watched with eager eyes. They sighed, and breathed hard, and sighed again, and never took their eyes from the sky for a moment. For the wonder was all new to them—the fair wonder of a mountain dawn.\nThe sun rose higher and higher over the top of the Leap, and the colour in the sky changed to what Brenda called “only sunlight”.\nThen their voices all broke out at once.\n“Oh, how lovely!”\n“Wasn’t it red!”\n“Wasn’t the sun gold!”\n“Wasn’t the sky beautiful!”\n“I wouldn’t have missed it for anything in the world,” declared Lennie.\n“Neither would I,” said Mabel just as solemnly, and of course the little sisters echoed her words.\nThe fire was made, the billy boiled, and egg sandwiches were eaten on the wooden steps along with some tea, the mountains rolling out before them. It was the sweetest breakfast they had ever known. And, above all, it was five o’clock in the morning, and they were miles away from home, in the heart of the Blue Mountains.\n",
  "rjbgz21fb7c8e": "(Adapted from Red Star Over China by Edgar Snow)\nSome 400 li to the west of An Shun Chang, there was Luding Bridge, the last possible crossing of the Dadu River east of Tibet. Toward this the barefoot Red Army men now set out. If they captured Luding Bridge the whole army could enter central Sichuan. If they failed they would have to fight their way westward toward Li Jiang—a detour of more than a thousand li. Day and night the Red Army moved, pausing only for brief ten-minute rests and meals. “Victory was life,” said Peng Dehuai, “defeat was certain death.” On the second day, White Army reinforcements appeared, hurrying to Luding Bridge. For a whole day these troops raced each other along the stream, but gradually the leading Red soldiers pulled away from the enemy’s tired soldiers.\nLuding Bridge was built centuries ago. Thirteen heavy iron chains, with a span of some 100 yards or more, were stretched across the river, their ends imbedded on each side under great piles of cemented rock, beneath the stone bridgeheads. Thick boards lashed over the chains made the road of the bridge, but upon their arrival the Reds found that half of this wooden flooring had been removed, and before them only the bare iron chains swung to a point midway in the stream. At the northern bridgehead an enemy machine gun nest faced them, and behind it were positions held by a regiment of White troops. The bridge should, of course, have been destroyed, but the Sichuanese were sentimental about their few bridges; it was not easy to rebuild them, and they were costly. And who would have thought the Red Army would insanely try to cross on the chains alone? But that was what they did.\nNo time was to be lost. The bridge must be captured before enemy reinforcements arrived. Once more volunteers were called for. One by one Red soldiers ventured forward to risk their lives, and, of those who offered themselves, thirty were chosen. Hand grenades and Mausers were strapped to their backs, and soon they were swinging out above the boiling river, moving hand over hand, clinging to the swaying iron chains.\nThe Red Army’s machine guns sprayed the bridgehead with bullets. The enemy replied with machine-gunning of their own, and snipers shot at the Reds high above the water, working slowly toward them. The first warrior was hit, and splashed into the current below; a second fell, and then a third. But as others drew nearer the centre, the bridge flooring somewhat protected them, and most of the enemy bullets glanced off, or ended in the cliffs on the opposite bank.\nProbably never before had the Sichuanese seen fighters like these—men for whom soldiering was not just a rice bowl and youths ready to sacrifice themselves to win. Were they human beings or madmen? Was their own morale affected? Did they perhaps not shoot to kill? Did some of them secretly hope that these men would succeed in their attempt? At last one Red crawled up over the bridge flooring, and tossed a grenade with perfect aim into the enemy position. Nationalist officers ordered the rest of the planking torn up. It was already too late. More Reds were crawling into sight. Wax was thrown on the planking, and it began to burn. By then about twenty Reds were moving forward on their hands and knees, tossing grenade after grenade into the enemy machine gun nest.\nSuddenly, on the southern shore, their comrades began to shout with joy. “Long live the Red Army! Long live the Revolution! Long live the heroes of the Dadu River!” For the enemy was withdrawing. Running full speed over the remaining planks of the bridge, through the flames licking toward them, the Red Army soldiers hopped into the enemy’s now vacant position and turned the abandoned machine gun against the shore.\nMore Reds now came over the chains, and arrived to help put out the fire and replace the boards. And soon afterwards the Red division that had crossed at An Shun Chang came into sight, opening a flank attack on the remaining enemy positions, so that in a little while the White troops were completely in flight—either in flight, that is, or with the Reds, for about a hundred Sichuan soldiers here threw down their rifles and turned to join the Reds. In an hour or two the whole army was happily singing its way across the Dadu River into Sichuan. Far overhead roared the planes of Jiang Jieshi, and the Reds yelled out in challenge to them.\nFor their bravery the heroes of An Shun Chang and Luding Bridge were awarded the Gold Star, highest decoration in the Red Army of China.\n",
  "rjbgz221202f5": "Young people today will be concerned with what the future might hold, with many challenges facing them. In general, one might simply aspire to be happy and secure with enough to enjoy a good lifestyle. The question of personal wealth inevitably arises, but one cannot and should not always rely on others for money. However, if one only gets a little pocket money or cash from a part-time job, it is hard to imagine a future of personal wealth becoming a reality. The truth is that personal wealth stems from investment, and there is no amount too small to start investing, especially when one has the benefit of time! This is where the power of compounding can work miracles.\nUnderstanding the secret of compound interest or compounding is a fundamental part of increasing our financial literacy and is a method whereby we can gain control over our money and the freedom that brings. First, we must understand how interest works. Simple interest is the amount of extra money you get back when you put a sum of money in a bank account or other investment. This money you put in is a “deposit”, also known as the “principal” or “capital” of the investment. The bank will offer a rate of interest for a certain period of time, say 3% for one year. Therefore, if one makes a deposit of ￥1,000, after one year you will have ￥1,030: your principal, plus 3%.\nCompound interest is when interest is paid on the original deposit, and, most importantly, with any interest already earned. By earning interest on the principal AND the interest already earned on top, the overall amount begins to grow at a greater pace over time. By keeping our ￥1,030 invested for longer without withdrawing any money, we end up with more than if we spend the interest. As this chart illustrates, at first the two types give the same result, but then by earning “interest on interest”, the compounding curve begins to exceed that of simple interest.\nThe next thing to appreciate is that compound interest can work for you or against you. Albert Einstein is purported to have hailed it as the “eighth wonder of the world”, however added that those who understand it earn it, but those who do not, pay it! Whereas interest is paid to you when you deposit money, it is charged to you when you borrow it. Interest rates are always higher when borrowing than saving! That is why this is a “secret” because many people may not fully understand how it works and therefore pay it rather than earn it.\nAnother hint that helps you use compounding to your advantage is known as the handy “Rule of 72” This tells us how many years it will take a deposit or investment to double in value. We divide 72 by the rate of interest, for example 5%. That gives us 72/5 = 14.4. So, if we invest ￥1,000 at an unchanging rate of 5%, it will reach ￥2,000 in just over 14 years. If we can get a rate of 6%, it will only take 12 years, and 10%, just over 7 years. Again, this illustrates the a dvantage of starting early; although one might not be able to find a 10% return over a long period, compounding at a lower rate still gives a good result over time.\nOf course, any attempt to forecast future returns assumes a level of interest in the future. This rate of interest is influenced by many factors and cannot always be guaranteed. In the world today, interest rates are historically very low, so most bank accounts pay litle interest. Although compounding will still work over a long period of time, in times of historically low interest rates it is especially important to start saving early. If you look for a higher interest rate to be paid on the capital, you will have to look to other investments than a simple bank account. There are many other ways to invest, but they are riskier. All investments involve a degree of risk of some kind, so be cautious and not invest more money than you can afford to lose. Don’t invest in something you don’t really understand or just because everyone else seems to be doing it. It is also essential to comply with the tax laws of your country as you may be liable for tax.\nIt may seem that as a young person who does not earn a lot, you will find it difficult to enrich yourself financially to prosper in the near future, but this ignores perhaps the biggest asset a young person has: time! Therefore, the secret of this “eighth wonder” is to start saving today!\n",
  "rjbgz221ae2f4": "Long ago in China there was an emperor whose palace was the most beautiful in the world. It had a remarkable garden that extended into a great forest, and in one of its trees lived a nightingale, who sang so beautifully that anyone who passed by would stop and listen in awe.\nTravellers from all over the world came to admire the sanctuary of the emperor’s home, but when they heard the nightingale, they all asserted it to be the best of all. Some, on their return home, composed beautiful verses about the nightingale, and one of the verses came into the hands of the emperor. Sitting on his throne, he frequently nodded his approval as he read beautiful descriptions of his palace and garden. But when he came to the words, “the marvellous nightingale is the most beautiful of all,” he asked, “Is there such a bird in my garden? I have never even heard of it!”\nHe instructed the court to go through the palace and find anyone who knew about this nightingale, a bird that inspired such wonder.\nEventually a poor kitchen girl said, “I know the nightingale well. Every evening I visit my poor sick mother who lives deep in the forest, and, as I pass through the wood, I listen to her beautiful song.”\nShe led the court into the wood where the nightingale sang.\n“There she is!” said the girl, glimpsing the little bird among the branches.\n“Nightingale,” cried the girl, “the emperor, who is our most gracious leader, wishes you to sing before him.”\nThe bird appeared and said, “My song sounds best in this wood,” but still she went to the palace willingly when she heard the emperor’s wish.\nA golden perch was made for the nightingale to sit on.\nSeeing the emperor, the bird sang so sweetly that tears came to the emperor’s eyes his heart being so utterly moved by its beauty. He was so delighted that he declared the nightingale should have a gold necklace to wear round her neck, but she declined with thanks.\n“My reward is that I have seen the emperor’s tears,” she said.\nThe nightingale’s visit was so successful, the emperor confined her to the palace indefinitely, and guardians were appointed to make sure she could not fly away.\nOne day the emperor received a large parcel labelled “The Nightingale”. Inside was a mechanical nightingale, that resembled the living one, covered all over with precious jewels. When this artificial bird was wound up, it sang like the real one and when it moved, it sparkled with silver and gold. It sang the same tune many times without becoming tired. However, amid all the fuss no one had noticed that the living bird had flown out of an open window.\nThe court said she was an ungrateful bird and forbade her from entering the palace. The people were then allowed to listen to the artificial bird, and although they liked it, they thought it was not quite the same as the real nightingale.\nA year passed, and one evening, the song of the artificial bird abruptly halted, as its mechanism had worn out.\nFive more years passed, and the emperor became so ill that he was not expected to live.\nAs he lay on his bed, scarcely able to breathe, he opened his eyes, and saw Death sitting there, wearing the emperor’s golden crown, and holding his sword and banner.\n“Music!” he cried, “Little bird, sing, please sing!” But the bird remained silent. And Death continued to stare at him with his cold, hollow eyes.\nSuddenly the sound of sweet music came through the window. On the branch of a tree, sat the living nightingale. She had heard of the news that the emperor was seriously ill and came to sing to him. And as she sang, the emperor’s blood flowed more rapidly giving life to his weak body, and even Death himself listened and encouraged the nightingale to continue.\n“Death, will you give me the emperor’s sword, banner, and crown?” asked the bird. Death gave them all for a song. She sang of the quiet churchyard, where the white roses grew. Death longed to go to the churchyard and floated out through the window into the cold night.\n“Thanks, heavenly little bird.” said the emperor, “How can I reward you?”\n“You already have,” said the nightingale. “Your tears the first time I sang to you are the jewels that rejoice a singer’s heart.”\n“You must always remain with me,” said the emperor.\n“I cannot live here, but I will come and sing to you in the evening. I will sing to you of those who are happy, and those who suffer; of the good and the evil who are hidden around you. I will fly far from you and your court to the home of the fisherman and the peasant. I love your heart better than your crown. I will come, will sing to you; but you must promise me one thing.”\n“Any thing,” said the emperor.\n“Let no one know that you have a little companion who tells you everything,” said the bird and flew away. When the servants returned to the sick emperor, there he stood, and, to their surprise, said, “Good morning!”\n",
  "rjbgz22456ff4": "(Adapted from Aeneid by Virgil)\nFancying the Greeks were gone and had finally ended their siege, the city of Troy put its ten-year grief away. Citizens of all ages were overjoyed to hear the news that the enemy had finally withdrawn. The gates were flung open and they went cheerfully to see the abandoned shore, where a mountainous wooden horse stood alone. Some gazed astonished at is impressively large size. Some said that it should be drawn within the walls and set in the city while some suggested either throwing this evil gift into the sea or burning it. The wavering crowd was divided in high dispute.\nAt that, Laocoon, a priest, ran hotly to the shore, crying. “Trust not the horse, Trojans!\nI fear the Greeks even when they offer gifts.” Thus speaking, he threw his spear with great strength at the creature’s belly: the spear stood shivering, and the belly sounded hollow and uttered a groan.\nShepherds meanwhile dragged before the king a man with his hands tied behind his back. He stood, looking frightened, and cast his eyes around the crowd, “Alas!”he cried,“What is the last doom that awaits my misery? I have no place among the Greeks, and the Trojans demand my blood!” Hearing his sad story, the crowd’s spit changed, and they encouraged him to speak.\n“Oh King,” said the trembling man, “Whatever if may take, I will confess to you the truth; nor will I deny myself of Greek birth—nor, if Fortune has made me. Sinon, unhappy, shall she change me into a liar.”\nThe man named Sinon continued to speak, “Often would the Greeks have taken fight, leaving Troy behind in weariness of the long war. Yet the wild seas barred their way, and a sacrifice was demanded. The decision was made that I would be appointed for the altar! However, I broke free and hid all night in the grass, till the Greeks had set sail. I have no hope of ever seeing my home nor my sweet children again!”\nAt his tears, the Trojans took pity on him. The command was given that his bonds be undone. The king spoke kindly, “Whoever you are, now forget the Greeks; you shall be ours. And unfold the truth to my question: Why have the Greeks built this horse?” Sinon answered, “It was built as a gift for Athena for their safe return home. They made it this huge size, so you may not draw it within the city and protect your people beneath Athena.”\nAs soon as Sinon finished, a terrible sight appeared. Two snakes advanced together towards Laocoon. At first, they twisted around his two children, and bit deep into their arms. As he came to help them, they twisted around him too. The priest struggled to get rid of them but could not and yelled in great pain. The two snakes glided away to the sanctuary of Athena and took shelter under the goddess’ shield. A strange horror overwhelmed everyone. Laocoon, they say, was doomed as he pierced the horse with his guilty spear. And yet all cried out that the horse must be drawn to its new home and prayers made to Athena.\nThe Trojans opened their city and set to work. They fixed rolling wheels under the horse’s feet and tied bands on its neck. Around it, boys and girls joyfully sang and laid their hands on the ropes. Slowly it moved, sliding into the city. Four times the sound of metal rang out within the horse. Yet the citizens urged it on.\nMeanwhile the heavens wheeled on, and night rose from the sea, wrapping in her vast shadow earth and sky and the tricks of the Greeks. Throughout the city the Trojans were stretched in silent sleep. But under the quiet moon the Greek army secretly sailed back to the shore they now knew so well. Sinon stealthily opened the horse and all the Greek warriors hidden inside it climbed out. They quickly swept across the city that was still buried in drunken sleep. They cut down the watchmen, and at the open gates they welcomed their comrades and united their troops.\nThe noises grew louder and the clash of metal swelled. A Trojan general, shook himself from sleep with alerted ears: as when fire caught a corn field while south winds were furious, sweeping away the smiling crops, and then consumed the forest; the helpless shepherd on the mountain heard the roar.\nThe horse, standing high above the city, looked down as more armed men poured forward. Sinon scattered fire here and there, arrogant in victory. Thousands of soldiers had passed through the gates. The narrow streets were now full of weapons; shining points of steel stood drawn, ready for combat.\n“Hearts of bravery!” the brave Trojan general shouted at his fellows, “Let us die, and rush on their weapons! The conquered have one safety, to hope for none!”\nThen, like wolves in a black fog, whom hunger had driven blindly forward; through the weapons of the enemy, they marched their way straight to certain death.\n",
  "rjbgz224f4d9b": "(Adapted from Odyssey by Homer)\nWhen the dawn came, the Cyclops again lit his fire and miked his sheep. As soon as he had finished his work, he clutched up two more of my men, and made them his grim morning’s meal. The fact that this monster could so easily catch and eat us was truly horrible. Presently, with great ease, he rolled the stone away from the entrance of the cave in which we were his captives. After driving out his sheep, he at once put it back again, as easily as though he were merely putting the lid on a quiver of arrows. As soon as he had done so he yelled after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain, so I was left to devise some way of taking revenge.\nAfter a while a plan came to me. The Cyclops had a large piece of wood, a great club, which was lying in the cave. It was so huge that one could only compare it to the size of a great ship. I went up to this club and cut off about six feet of it, then my men and I made it smooth at one end, bringing it to a point and charred it in the fire to make it harder. When this was done, I hid it and chose four men to help me lift it to blind the Cyclops while he slept. The monster had no idea what l intended to do. In the evening he came back, shepherded his flocks into the cave to milk them, and put the stone back in its place. When he had finished, he grabbed two more of my men, and made his brutal supper of them.\nSo, I went up to him with a bucket of wine in my hands.“Look here, Cyclops.” I pleaded in earnest, “you have preyed on many of my men, so take this and drink some wine, that you may see what kind of liquor we had on board my ship. It is an offering to you, in the hope that you will take compassion upon us.”\nHe clutched the bucket and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of the wine that he demanded another. “This drink, this nectar of the gods, is the greatest thing I have ever tasted!” he said, “Give me more, and tell me your name at once; then I will give you a present that you will be glad to have.”\nI gave him three more buckets, and three times did he drain them immediately. When I saw that the wine had gone to his head, I said to him as sincerely as I could, “Cyclops, my name is Noman; this is what everyone has always called me. Give me now the present you promised.”\nBut the Cyclops, revealing himself to be a truly wicked beast, said, “Then I will eat all Noman’s men before Noman himself, and will keep Noman for the last. This is my present for him!”\nAs he spoke, he reeled, and fell onto his back with a great thud, and a deep drunken sleep took hold upon him. My men gathered round me, their hearts filled with courage. We drove the sharp end of the club into the monster’s eye. Driven crazy by rage and pain, he shouted to the other Cyclopes who lived near him; and they gathered round his cave when they heard him crying and asked what the matter with him was.\n“What burdens you our friend,” they said, “that you make such a noise, breaking the stillness of the night, that prevents us from sleeping? Surely no man is crying off your sheep. Surely no man is trying to kill you either!”\nBut the Cyclops shouted to them from inside the cave, “Noman is killing me!”\n“Then,” said they,“if no man is attacking you, you must be ill; when Zeus makes people ill, there is no help for them. You had better pray to your father, the god of the sea!”\nThey went away, but the Cyclops, groaning in agony, felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it to catch anyone going out with the sheep, for he thought we might be foolish enough to attempt this.\nThe male sheep were huge with deep and heavy black fleeces, so I bound them together in threes with cord. There were to be three sheep to each man, who would fasten themselves under their bellies to hide. This might be the last chance for all of us to escape death. Thus, we waited still as rocks in fear at the monster’s anger till morning came. When it did, the male sheep hurried out to feed, and, despite the dangerous and blinded monster violently thrashing around the cave to find us, we escaped the horror of that prison into the fresh air, our hearts lifted though still heavy at the loss of our friends. We left that damaged monster to his fate.\n",
  "rjbgz225a4497": "Early 2020 witnessed an unprecedented war in Wuhan. With the coming of the Year of the Rat came the COVlD-19 virus. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, no other virus had attacked so rapidly or been more highly infectious. This unseen enemy called for a tough strategy of long-term prevention and control, requiring Wuhan to lock down for a staggering 76 days—from 23 January to 8 April. The sufferings and sacrifices of tens of millions of Wuhan residents were immense, but they had to bear the attack of the virus in order to protect China and the rest of the world. Remarkably, as the situation grew worse, the people of Wuhan grew closer together. It was their positivity and hope that led to Wuhan’s eventual victory over the epidemic, leaving behind numerous heartfelt stories of unity and bravery.\nDuring the lockdown battle, it was the medical staff who held the frontline. There were 346 national medical teams consisting of over 42,000 medical workers from all over the country who aided Wuhan and Hubei Province. The battle armour worn by these medical troops was the bulky and awkward hazmat suit. It took as long as half an hour to put on, with two protective layers to struggle with, not to mention the intense heat. The medical staff’s job was to treat and take care of the COVID-19 patients, which would seem nearly impossible in such clothing. Many medical staff did not even find the time to eat, drink, or use the toilet during their six-to-eight-hour shifts. “It is by universal love and natural benevolence that I’m summoned here to Wuhan. Even if it were storms of bullets ahead, I would still fight on,” said one doctor from Liaoning Province.\nThe remarkable Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals were the battlegrounds of the COVID-19 war. The two hospitals were created in breathtaking 10 days and 12 days respectively. It was the selfless dedication of hundreds of designers and over 40,000 construction workers that made it possible, providing a boost of 2,600 lifesaving beds that eventually cared for over 5,000 patients. What is more, to aid in Wuhan’s struggle, temporary treatment centres, known as fangcang, were set up to provide extra beds, greatly helping to turn the tide in the war. And China’s manufacturing industry joined in the fight by significantly increasing its production of face masks and protective gear, creating a defensive barrier for the whole of China.\nDuring the epidemic, Wuhan’s citizens were like an army that was guarding against the disease. But an army marches on its stomach and it was an enormous challenge to feed the more than nine million residents of Wuhan. On average, Wuhan’s residents consume 5,400 tons of grain, 4,000 tons of vegetables, and 1,200 tons of meat every day, and that is not mentioning all the water, electricity, and gas they consume. One electricity worker emphasised the importance of all the logistics work, saying, “As long as the light in each window is on, there is light, hope, warmth, and confidence.” And at a more local level, few noticed the many unsung heroes who were moving courageously around the city during this critical period providing essential services, such as the couriers, sanitation workers, transport employees, police personnel, and media workers. But this all soon changed, with many “normal workers” becoming known and loved by the local residents. With millions of people quarantined at home and unable or unwilling to go outside, these heroes felt a proud sense of the great necessity of their work. They became cherished for their essential, endless effort in keeping the local society woven together into a united whole.\nOf course, Wuhan was never alone—the whole of China was its ally, uniting together in a country-wide effort to protect the city and the surrounding area. Millions signed up to join the fight, with 8.81 million volunteers from all over the country doing their bit to help, taking part in more than 460,000 volunteer projects during the first five months of the year, contributing to more than 290 million hours of voluntary service. In addition to this, countries from all over the world joined the Wuhan cause, offering valuable resources and medical expertise. Japan, for instance, donated medical materials and protective gear, some with extremely touching lines of a Chinese poem written on the containers: “Mountains and rivers apart, we share the same winds and moon under the same sky.”\nThe victory of the Wuhan COVID-19 war proved that solidarity is strength. Following such a sudden outbreak, the whole of China stayed calm and united under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China. When disaster struck, help came from all sides. It just goes to show that when we work together, we can conquer any difficulty. The Wuhan story was also a true representation of modern worldwide unity. When everyone in the world believes they are part of the same global community with a shared future, we can fight together to stay safe and build a better world. No winter lasts forever, and no spring skips its turn.\n",
  "rjbgz22621194": "On 26 August 1980, Shenzhen was given a new mission to become a trailblazer in China’s opening up. On that day, the National People’s Congress accepted the proposal to establish the southern city as China’s first special economic zone (SEZ). This was the brainchild of the late leader and chief architect of China’s reform, Deng Xiaoping. Such an experiment, combining socialism with Chinese characteristics and a market-oriented economy, turned a tiny fishing village to a small city of just over 330,000 inhabitants then into a modem high-tech metropolis of 17 million people. Shenzhen’s location made it the perfect touchstone for this project. About 40 years ago, with the main industry being fishing, its gross domestic product (GDP) was only 270 million yuan ($41.7 million). In contrast, by 2020 its GDP had skyrocketed to 2.77 trillion yuan ($428 billion). It is therefore no wonder that this incredible growth led to the description, the “Miracle of Shenzhen”.\nBeing selected as an SEZ endowed Shenzhen with certain powers beyond other cities in China.\nThe city gained a degree of autonomy to pursue reforms that kept it “one step ahead” of the rest of the country. It benefited from lower tax rates and gained more control over economic development including the authority to approve foreign investment. The Shenzhen SEZ was initially driven by the following:\n· Construction primarily relying on foreign capital through foreign direct investment (FDI)\n· Utilising Sino-foreign joint ventures (JV), partnerships, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises (WFOE) as primary economic forms\n· Producing primarily for export\n· Market forces driving economic activities\nWith Shenzhen being firmly established as an SEZ in 1980, a wave of economic progression was triggered that spread across the country in the following decades. Xiamen in Fujian Province, together with Shenzhen, was accepted as an SEZ, and so were Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong Province. In addition, Hainan Province also became an SEZ in 1988. This process was accompanied by “open door” measures, such as making 14 cities “open coastal cities” in 1984. Then in 1985, the two deltas of the Yangtze River and Pearl River, and the Xiamen-Zhangzhou- Quanzhou triangle in southern Fujian were approved as coastal economic open zones (EOZs) . These policies have made an important contribution in making China the second largest economy in the world in 2020.\nShenzhen evolved from mainly developing foreign trade to pursuing high-level opening up in an all-round way. Now Shenzhen being the high-tech and manufacturing hub of southern China, people often refer to the city and the surrounding region as the “world factory”. It is home to the headquarters of several of China’s largest and most well-known companies, such as Huawei, DJI (Dajiang), and Tencent, whose global influence has also helped the city to become known as China’s “Silicon Valley”. Sectors such as high-tech telecommunications, artificial intelligence (Al), new energy, and cultural industries are the new engines for economic growth. Shenzhen embraced independent and innovative industries as the dominant strategy for future development, giving it a pivotal role in the implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). All this has contributed to a city that moves at great velocity and efficiency, leading to the expression that “One week in Shenzhen is like one month everywhere else.”\nThe vitality and dynamism of this southern city is reflected in its inhabitants, whose lifestyle and spirit embody the essence of the principles on which the modem city was founded. This prompted the municipal government to describe Shenzhen citizens as “pioneering and innovative, honest and law-abiding, pragmatic and efficient, united and dedicated” in 2003. A population of enterprising people, consisting of a majority of migrant workers—leading to the title “Migrant city”—to PhD scholars, makes Shenzhen a core part of the socio-demographic revolution across the country.\nA generous and tolerant attitude led to the title of China’s “Most charitable city” for several consecutive years. This spirit has also been felt across the globe. Shenzhen is elected one of the top ten Chinese cities popular with expatriates, who choose to settle there for the opportunities to prosper and its open-minded character. It has close connections with 23 sister cities and more than 60 friendship cities all around the world including Houston, Turin, and Brisbane.\nThe inhabitants of Shenzhen benefit from 21st century infrastructure. As well as cutting edge technology, there is an extensive public transportation system. Shenzhen’s well-managed and successful education system promises a bright future for students. There having been such a strong future-oriented vision focus on innovation, Shenzhen is like wise a model for sustainable economic development and green lifestyles. An ecological garden city, half of its total area is under environmental protection in which construction is banned. The unremitting modern development of an area with over 6,700 years of human activity has been a quest to create a modem 21st century city, integrating new technologies and grand buildings with human-scale street life, and green open spaces.\nShenzhen’s triumph over the last four decades has been a “miracle in industrialisation, urbanisation, and modernisation”, validating the city as a development prototype for not only other Chinese cities but cities across the planet.\n",
  "rjbgz227d87d6": "Do you feel that modern technology is leading to too much individualism in society? Have you noticed the people around you are often glued to their mobile devices, lost in their own world, taking no notice of the others around them? Do you think schools and workplaces lay too much emphasis on individual performance, overlooking the advantages of teamwork? It is factors like these that can lead us to feelings of isolation and unhappiness, which can trigger serious social problems. Bearing this in mind, we must recognise the valuable role cooperation has played in our past and realise its impact on our present and future.\nEver since the beginning of humankind, cooperation has been key to our survival. Take, for example, primitive tribes and their use of common symbols to unite their members together. The simplest form of this was the worshipping of a totem—often an animal figure, such as a bull or a snake. By a group of people following the same totem, its individual members would work together as a related unit. Dwelling in this cooperative environment was a very successful means for everyone to prosper. Not only did cooperation give people a sense of security and structure, it also gave them a sense of belonging and purpose. Due to these positive factors, cooperative communities began to evolve everywhere, with people clustering together in groups in order to benefit from the advantages of cooperation.\nFrom a psychology perspective, cooperation is fundamental to us all. It stops us from feeling alone, it gives us joy, and it provides emotional support and encouragement. As Alfred Adler, a world renowned Austrian psychiatrist, commented, “All human judgments of value and success are founded, in the end, upon cooperation; this is the great shared commonplace of the human race.” Adler also stated that a lack of cooperative spirit can lead to serious problems and criminality. Conversely, cooperation with others has been found to greatly benefit students and employees, significantly boosting their productivity and happiness levels. According to Marilee Sprenger, author of The Leadership Brain for Dummies, cooperation increases both happiness and motivation: “Working together and helping each other releases brain chemicals that enhance motivation, pleasure, and bonding... The brain strongly desires these feel-good chemicals, and so the team is intrinsically motivated.”\nToday, all around the world, from individuals to groups to countries, the usage of cooperation brings great results. As Aristotle put it, “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” This means that when individuals work together as a team, the resulting group effort can be much more productive than any solo efforts amounted together. This is because many tasks are impossible to complete individually. On the other hand, as a team, members can combine their mixed strengths and work as a whole to achieve much more. This principle can be confirmed by any sports coach; the most successful teams are those that focus on teamwork. Exclusively relying on individual skills does not bring consistent success—merging together in a coordinated effort does. In addition, over the centuries, many of our greatest discoveries and inventions were the result of individuals working together, building upon previous findings to accumulate knowledge and accomplish great things. And the same concept applies at a global level. Just look at international organisations such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Cooperation paves the way to providing much-needed help all around the world. To put it simply, we all fare much better when we look out for each other and cooperate.\nTo conclude, when we consider our natural traits, it is clear that we are fundamentally cooperative beings, and this cannot be ignored. Cooperation has been a crucial part of human history and our survival. So, while many people today may seem to be absorbed info the digital world, we have not lost our capacity for cooperation. Rather, we can find new ways using modem technology to upgrade our cooperative abilities with one another and so realise our full potential as humans, compelling us to accomplish great goals through teamwork.\n",
  "rjbgz229e32c3": "The concept of true friendship has been discussed throughout history. The famous essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson described a worthy friend as someone who is there for you in both good times and bad times. “Friendship,” he wrote, “is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country rambles, but also for rough roads and hard fare, shipwreck, poverty, and persecution.” But what are the defining traits that contribute to the making of a true friend? Broadly speaking, they can be split into three categories: positivity, care, and trustworthiness.\nBasically, you will never be a true friend unless you are positive. And if you are positive, you will be optimistic about life—that means you always look on the bright side and make the most of a bad situation. You see the humour in life, which, in fun, can really help your friends when they are in distress. A true friend is a fun-lover, someone who actively tries to enjoy life, being practical and proactive. Self-confidence is another attractive trait in a friend. Everyone loves to be around a confident person; so much more can be achieved when people live their life to the full. Confidence can actually be contagious, meaning that, over time, a true friend helps their friends flourish and become more confident. A true friend is also inspiring, encouraging their friends to live up to their potential rather than waste large chunks of time on fruitless tasks.\nWhile being positive does count for a lot, you also have to make sure that you are caring. Needless to say, true friends are empathetic. For example, how do you react when your friend does something in a strange way? Your reaction does matter. Friends see things from their own perspective, so put yourself in their shoes and see things from their perspective. However busy you are, you ought to fake time out to show empathy towards their situation without being judgmental. And true friends are supportive in both good and bad times. You must always be there to give your friends the congratulation and assurance that they truly deserve and need. Be on your friend’s side, cheering them up and cheering them on. Tied to this is the trait of being understanding. Learn the art of being a good listener, caring about what your friends say, giving them the time and opportunity to share their inner thoughts and fears. Lending them an ear so they can talk about their stressful day can really help. Finally, show them you are genuinely undemanding by never asking them to do something that would compromise their principles.\nPerhaps the most important true-friend category is trustworthiness, which is often the “make or break” element in a friendship. In this category, one essential trait is honesty. Always tell your true friends the truth, even if if causes a problem. It could be something that they are unaware of, or even something that they are reluctant to admit. It shows you have their best interests at heart. It is you, an honest friend, who keeps them on track. Another trait is dependability. People need someone they can count on, someone worthy of their trust, someone to reveal their true self to, and someone who will keep their secrets a secret. And, as a true friend, you are there for them—you are their rock. In fact, your friends see you as an extended part of themselves—someone they can rely on to help carry their burden, both physically and psychologically. After all, only a friend that gives a friend in need a hand can be a true friend. In addition to the above, loyalty is an indispensable trait of a true friend. You never betray a friend but rather stay on their side and stick up for them, even if if means you yourself have to suffer something in return. It is this willingness to “take a hit” for others that makes you a friend of great worth.\nIn closing, being a true friend is to show a deep commitment to another person. Friendship is like a garden—it takes time and patience to nurture. And if is quality, not quantity, that counts. By no means is it an easy undertaking, but the effort is more than worth it—because by being a true friend, you will gain a true friend in return.\n",
  "rjbgz22a33a25": "(Adapted From Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen)\nElizabeth Bennet had met Mr Darcy, a rich, handsome landowner, several times. She disliked him for his proud ways and coarse manners. When she sees him at his aunt’s house, she is astonished when he proposes marriage to her.\nAfter a brief interval, he came towards her in a breathless manner. “In vain have I struggled! It will not do. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I adore and love you.” Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. Her silence spurred him on to continue. He spoke fluently and warmly but was quite explicit about her low social rank, which led to Elizabeth’s immediate disapproval of him as a husband.\nAt first, in spite of disliking him, she did not discount his affection; she was sensitive to the pain she was going to cause him when she declined his offer of marriage. But as he continued to articulate in his arrogant way, she began to care less for his feelings. He concluded by hoping that she would accept his hand in marriage. He spoke of his anxiety, but it was evident from his face that he felt sure of her answer. It was this attitude of arrogance that gave Elizabeth the confidence to answer bluntly. “Sorry, sir, I cannot marry you.”\nMr Darcy listened to her words with great surprise. He struggled to control the expression on his face. The pause was dreadful. At length he asked, “And this is all the reply that I am to have! I might, perhaps, ask why I am refused so abruptly?”\n“I might as well enquire”, replied Elizabeth, “why you told me that you liked me against your will? But there are other things! Do you think that I would accept the man who has ruined the happiness of my beloved elder sister?”\nAs she spoke these words, Mr Darcy’s face flushed with colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt while she continued.“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you,”Elizabeth explained. “It was you who opposed the marriage of my sister with your friend.” With assumed calmness, Mr Darcy replied , “I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister, and I rejoice in my success.”\nElizabeth looked astonished. “And this is not the only reason I dislike you. Long ago, my initial opinion of you was decided when I was informed by Mr Wickham of his hardships.”\n“You take a special interest in that gentleman’s concerns,”said Darcy less calmly.\n“I certainly do. Who couldn’t help but feel sorry for his hardships?”\n“His hardships,” repeated Darcy irritably . “have been great indeed!”\n“He is poor because of you,” replied Elizabeth. “He is innocent yet you shrug off his hardships with extreme ease.”\n“And this,” cried Darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room, “is your opinion of me! Thank you for being so outspoken. My faults are heavy indeed! However, I am not ashamed of my actions, nor the feelings I have related to you in honesty. They were natural and just. And could you expect me to congratulate myself on wedding someone whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\nElizabeth felt herself growing angry. “You are mistaken, Mr Darcy if you think your patronising nature in offering me your hand in marriage would have pleased me. In fact, it spared me of any sentiment I might have felt in refusing you if you had behaved more like a gentleman.”\nHe replied politely and coldly. “You have said quite enough, madam. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness.” And with these words he hastily left the room.\n",
  "rjbgz22b409da": "His face smiling with delight, 24-year-old Brit, Jack Collins, opens the door of his company’s office in the heart of Shanghai, and introduces himself in flawless putonghua. After a tour of the office, whilst explaining his start-up and introducing all his team, all still delivered in fluent Chinese, we sit down at an open desk. “It’s a great idea, but why did you want to bring it to life in China ?” I ask him in English.\nCollins is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs choosing China as a base for their start-up businesses. With a master’s in business from a prestigious university, Collins’ love of technology and fashion led him to Shanghai, to set up his AR (augmented reality) app. He shows me how it works but asks me not to reveal too much. It uses AR and a social network for fashion P2P e-commerce. It is marvellous, and Collins hopes it will be a game-changer.\nBut why China ? London, Collins’ home, has many start-ups. “Chinese people are more open to new technology, and new lifestyle, mobile, and digital developments,” says Collins. “The English still do things more traditionally, so there is more potential here. One cannot come to China and not be carried away by its momentum.”The incentives for foreign start-ups to come to China are also clear, he says. China has promising demographics, with an immense market in its growing middle class. It also attracts a huge amount of investment, and Shanghai benefits from being a free-trade zone, with additional government funds and grants to help the start-up sector grow.\nAs Collins and other foreign talents have realised, China’s cities are among the largest and most active regions of entrepreneurial activity in the world today. But why did Collins deem Shanghai the best choice? “Beijing and Shenzhen are straight-up tech hubs. Shanghai is different. It’s cosmopolitan and China’s fashion capital, so start-ups have a synthesis of tech, e-commerce, and lifestyle elements.” Shanghai’s start-up ecosystem generates lots of activity, with lots of peers to collaborate with. “Everybody here has an idea that’s going to revolutionise the world. Not all will succeed, but it still makes it an exciting place to be!” With an expatriate population of over 200,000, the largest in China, it has repeatedly been voted by expats as the most attractive Chinese city to work in. This foreign-friendly culture has been cultivated over time and with administrative help. The visa system was previously something of a deterrent for foreign start-ups, but this has been changed to welcome them in. As an eligible applicant it only took a short trip to the city’s exit-entry administration bureau and an interview for Collins. “I was approved promptly after,” says Collins, “It was a great moment.”\nHowever, the buzz around start-ups here should not give the idea of a creative paradise. Many start-ups are aborted. Great persistence is needed to succeed. “It’s not all roses! Failures are common. Foreign start-ups should think twice before taking the plunge. But the nature of innovation is learning from failure,” says Collins. Although China is potentially a big market, there are many local start-ups competing for the same market. “Doing business here is certainly easier if you speak Chinese though it is not essential as many speak English. And although I am fluent, there are still mistakes and misunderstandings!” he laughs. But seeing failures as a positive just adds fuel to the fire.“You learn to let it fuel your passion. Ultimately, if you want to succeed in China, you really have to be here, engaging with the culture and language,” he says conclusively. Cross-culture communication and understanding is clearly a crucial factor in taking a start-up to a global level in Collins’ eyes.\nLooking forward, which start-up trends does he think will shape the coming decade ? New technology will always trend strongly, he says, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) leading the field.\nHowever, Collins believes there is already a move away from what originally made the “start-up” such a buzzword. “The culture is still seen as ‘cool’. Some have the wrong attitude, that it is an easy way to make a quick fortune.”Collins says this has led to failures which may dry up future investment. “I think the culture will adapt accordingly to become a valid and universal pattern of business creation. We need entrepreneurs with an adventurous spirit but also the right attitude, who are doing it for the right reasons.” In fact, this is already happening.“More start-ups are being founded with strong ethical and environmental principles, focussing on social responsibility, and sustainable products and services. There are many young Chinese here doing this right now. That has grown organically from our generations facing the great challenges of the future.”\nAs he bids me farewell, it is impossible not to let some of Collins’ passion rub off on you. Yet he is just one of many expats and Chinese taking advantage of the welcoming start-up climate and helping turn China into one of the future leaders of innovation in the 21st century. In a way, the idea of the start-up is as old as the first entrepreneur. It is just done with the benefit of modern technology. And a country that cultivates a thriving start-up culture gives young people with a good idea the best chance of making that a reality and changing the world. Simple as that!\n",
  "rjbgz22b8a0c5": "Although we live in a globalised world where trade takes place on a grand scale between huge multinational entities, much economic activity still takes place between individuals on a much smaller scale. Until recent years, the term sharing economy was relatively unknown, but today the situation is vastly different, with an abundance of enterprises making this a leading business model across the world. The sharing economy is defined as the peer-to-peer (P2P) activity of acquiring, providing, or sharing goods and services, usually facilitated by an online platform. The focus is on sharing assets that are not fully utilised, in a way that improves efficiency and sustainability but also community, while challenging the more traditional concept of ownership.\nPeople have assets such as a house or car, but also their skills and time. There is often scope for them to utilise these assets better. For example, if one lives in a city popular with tourists and has a spare room that is idle most of the time, why not let a tourist rent it? Then one can make some money, and the tourist gets a cheaper room and is also the beneficiary of direct contact with a local resident. Another successful business within the new model is “ridesharing”. Car owners pay a lot to purchase and maintain an automobile, but it usually sits unused for more than 90% of the time. The owner might commute to work by themselves in a car that can hold four people, so why not find others who take the same route and maximise efficiency? They could also supplement their income by using the car as a local taxi on the weekend on condition that the local regulations allow. The same principle has been used to allow people to share their parking place for others to park in, their spare space for others to store their stuff. Today one can rent anything you own to others such as a bike, Wi-Fi, or even kitchen utensils!\nThe simplicity of the sharing economy is something one might have expected to have appeared sooner; however, it was the rise of high-speed Internet and perhaps most importantly, the predominance of smart phones that really made it viable. Part of the spirit of the sharing economy, at least in its preliminary stages, was also to give some power and control back to individuals and small companies. These new methods of economic interaction often bypassed the “middleman”, such as big companies, by putting people in direct contact with each other, the “peer to peer”. By doing things on this scale, cash is put in the pockets of the community rather than big companies. The sharing economy is described as “disruptive” because if has flourished quickly and changed the way business is done for everyone. It also led to an explosion of innovation as people and companies realised the potential of this new way of doing things, creating connected models based on similar principles.\nThe crowd economy is a related model that illustrates this. Usually, a new business would approach a bank or financial entity to borrow money for a new product or service. But now crowdfunding puts someone with an idea for a product or service directly in contacf with potential customers. The product or service is presented through an app, website or social media, and interested customers can pledge money for it. This money is then used as capital for the product to be manufactured. People funding the project are rewarded with the final product, further benefits and get to build a direcf relationship with the creator. Crowdsourcing is a connected term, used for example to get information or help for a project directly from a large group of people.\nNonetheless, as is perhaps inevitable within a capitalist economy, the purity of the original idea has met with problems as it has developed in the real world. The sharing economy has seen much controversy in recent years, and in many ways has become a victim of its own success. Many businesses that appear to be part of the sharing economy are not really “sharing” in the way originally conceived. For example, companies began to use online platforms to rent multiple properties that they then rented themselves. In some major cities this led to problems where local residents found a lack of properties to rent. The new models also exposed holes in local regulation. Big companies began to use the term to sound trendy too, and to cope with the disruption this evolution of business brought. Therefore, the term today has expanded to include business to business (B2B) interactions. This will undoubtedly see the value of the sharing economy continue to rise as more and more traditional models are disrupted, and companies and individuals look to this versatile idea and the latest technology to do business in the future.\n",
  "rjbgz22bd6f6c": "Although thousands of years old, the influence of ancient legends and tales on modern English language and culture should not be underestimated. Through centuries of repetition, the stories, characters, words, and phrases of these ancient stories have become a frequent occurrence in everyday discourse. Those of ancient Greece and Rome constitute the largest contribution in the West, giving many words, phrases and idioms to modern English. Therefore, understanding a culture’s ancient stories and their cultural connotations can really help us understand many aspects of the language. Here are some common examples.\nAn “Achilles’ heel” is a vulnerable or weak spot on someone or something that otherwise appears strong. This is named after the legendary warrior of the Trojan War. The legend has it that Achilles’ mother held her infant son by the heel and plunged him into the mythical river between the world of the living and the dead. Doing this made him invulnerable, except for his heel. After being hailed as the hero of the Trojan War, Achilles was killed by a poisoned arrow that pierced the flesh of his heel. The tendon at the back of foot is also known as the “Achilles tendon”. The Trojan War also gave us the term “Trojan horse” which is used today in computer security to describe a wicked programme that appears helpful at first or is hidden in something else. The legend also led to the expression “beware of Greeks bearing gifts.”\nIn Homer’s other classic work, the Odyssey, Odysseus must drive his ship past one of two sea monsters: Charybdis, a perilous ship-swallowing monster, and Scylla, a six-headed monster. The hero chooses Scylla as the “lesser of two evils”, but if you are stuck in a situation where you have to choose between two equally unpleasant things, you are “between Scylla and Charybdis”. In addition, today the word “odyssey” means a long exotic journey with a lot of interesting and exciting adventures.\nIf someone says he or she has the “sword of Damocles” hanging over him or her, it means there is a bad or unpleasant thing that might happen any time which is making him or her anxious or scared. Damocles was a courtier of the Greek king, Dionysius the Younger. He told his king how fortunate he was to be a powerful king. Dionysius offered to switch places with Damocles for one day, but he had a sword placed above the throne supported by a single horse’s hair. The anxiety made Damocles beg to change back when he realised that with great power comes great anxiety and danger as well.\nThe mighty Hercules is a legendary character known for great strength and the twelve seemingly impossible tasks he had to complete as a punishment from the king of Greece. He had to kill a lion, whose golden fur was invulnerable. Today a Herculean task is something that requires great strength, determination, or effort.\nAnother great influence on language and culture was the storyteller Aesop, whose fables have been passed down in multiple forms for more than 2,000 years. These simple tales used animals to depict moral situations and were concluded with a maxim to educate the reader. Many phrases and sayings still in common use emerged from these tales. The fable of “The Fox and The Grapes” tells of a fox trying to get some grapes from a vine. Because he cannot reach them, he decides they are probably sour anyway. The phrase “sour grapes” is now used to describe someone who fails to get what he or she wants, and so speaks critically and unfavourably about that thing. “The Boy Who Cried Wolf” is just another tale told by Aesop. To “cry wolf” means to raise a false alarm and so not to be believed when a real problem arises, or to lie repeatedly until no one can trust what is said.\nThe names of characters from legends and tales are also commonly used today to describe those with specific characteristics. For example, to call a man an “Adonis” means he is young and extremely attractive, like the shepherd boy who became the lover of the Greek goddess of love, Aphrodite. Someone is called a “narcissist” if he or she is obsessed with his or her own appearance like Narcissus, the Greek who fell in love with his own reflection. To “play Cupid” means to help start a romantic relationship between two people, like the Roman god of love, depicted as a baby boy with a bow and arrow. Someone called a “Cassandra” usually predicts that something bad will happen but is not believed. The god Apollo had given her the power to predict, but she tricked him, so Apollo cursed her by stopping people from believing her.\nLegendary names are also the source of many common words. For example, January is named after Janus, the god of beginnings in Roman myth. Saturday is named after the Roman god, Saturn, as is the planet. Thursday comes from the Old English word meaning “Thor’s Day”, named after the god of thunder Thor.\nLanguage and culture develop over a long time, building upon what has come before.

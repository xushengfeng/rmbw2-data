      "text": "Human beings' curiosity about outer space hasn't declined in the past decade，and with Jeff Bezos' historic commercial flight to the edge of space this past summer，dreamers are that much closer to experiencing the Galaxy for themselves.\n\nIt's reported that one company is aiming to make space a reality for people，and is pioneering a new age of space tourism.In 2019，the California­based company Gateway Foundation first explored the idea.Its dream was to make visiting space，in excellent accommodation，a future vacation choice.The project，now called Voyager Station，is run by Orbital Assembly Corporation，a construction company led by head of the Gateway Foundation and former pilot，John Blincow.\n\nSpace tourism draws closer as Orbital Assembly Corporation has announced plans to build the world's first space hotel named “Voyager Station”，which is expected to open in 2027.With a date in close sight，the hotel's architects and engineers are hard at work，aiming to design an out­of­this­world experience.They plan to decorate the suites with elegant bars and restaurants with a touch of space，as well as Earth­viewing lounges and unique space food treats.The team is also taking advantage of the reduced gravity that will be felt in the station to plan to let their guests weightlessly carry heavy objects，jump higher or run faster in ways people can't normally do on Earth.\n\nGravity will remain in the rooms and bars though because Voyager Station's scientific design makes it possible by creating artificial gravity within the hotel.The hotel is designed as a wheel that will steadily move and create simulated gravitational force，much like when a glass of water is spun around，the water doesn't pour out.The hotel's guests won't feel much different than being on a huge ship steadily moving.\n\n\n\n5．What do we know about the Gateway Foundation?\n\n_A．It aimed to build a space hotel.\n\nB．It made space a reality for people.\n\nC．It promoted space tourism greatly.\n\nD．It planned a historic commercial flight.\n\n\n\n6．What will the Voyager Station team use the reduced gravity to do?\n\nA．Provide unique space food.\n\nB．Let guests do space sports.\n\n_C．Offer recreational activities.\n\nD．Decorate suites more easily.\n\n\n\n7．Why does gravity exist in the rooms and bars?\n\nA．To prevent liquid from pouring.\n\n_B．To make guests feel comfortable.\n\nC．To avoid guests' travel sickness.\n\nD．To keep things in normal positions.\n\n\n\n8．What's the text mainly about?\n\nA．Time for Space Travel.\n\nB．Space tourism gaining popularity.\n\nC．First­ever commercial flight to space.\n\n_D．First space hotel set to open in 2027.",

      "text": "The number of weather­related disasters has increased by five times over the past 50 years，the latest report by the World Meteorological (气象) Organization(WMO)said on September 1.However，thanks to improved early warning systems and disaster management，the number of death from these hazards (危险) has been almost three times less.\n\nAccording to the WMO，from 1970 to 2019，weather，climate and water hazards accounted for 50 percent of all disasters.Among the top 10 hazards that led to the largest loss of human life during this period were droughts，storms，floods and extreme temperatures.However，deaths fell from over 50,000 in the 1970s to less than 20,000 in the 2010s.\n\n“Weather，climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change，” says WMO Secretary­General Petteri Taalas.\n\n“That means more heatwaves，drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America.We have more water vapor in the atmosphere，which is worsening extreme rainfall and deadly flooding.The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms.”\n\n“Economic losses are increasing as exposure increases.But behind the statistics lies a message of hope.Improved multi­hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in deaths.Quite simply，we are better than ever before at saving lives，” Taalas said.\n\n1．What do we know from the first paragraph?\n\nA．Disasters connected with weather have gone up.\n\nB．The number of weather­related disasters has decreased.\n\nC．The number of deaths from hazards has been increasing.\n\nD．Early warning systems has made disasters decline much.\n\n解析：细节理解题。由第一段第一句“The number of weather­related disasters has increased by five times over the past 50 years，the latest report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on September 1.”可知，与气候相关的灾难增多了。\n\n答案：A\n\n2．What will happen according to Petteri Taalas?\n\nA．There will be more extreme weather.\n\nB．Extreme rainfall will no longer exist.\n\nC．Water vapor in the atmosphere will go down.\n\nD．Human will conquer extreme weather in the end.\n\n解析：细节理解题。由第三段佩蒂瑞·塔拉斯说的话“Weather，climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change”可知，佩蒂瑞·塔拉斯认为极端天气会增多。\n\n答案：A\n\n3．What is hopeful behind the bad news?\n\nA．Improved warning systems will save economic losses.\n\nB．Economic losses are going down as exposure increases.\n\nC．More lives will be saved thanks to early warning systems.\n\nD．Improved early warning systems will control extreme weather.\n\n解析：细节理解题。由最后一段中的“But behind the statistics lies a message of hope.Improved multi­hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in deaths.”可知，预警系统会拯救更多生命。\n\n答案：C\n\n4．Where may the text be taken from?\n\nA．A novel.　　　　　\tB．A brochure.\n\nC．A guideline.  \tD．A magazine.\n\n解析：推理判断题。由第三段中的says WMO Secretary­General Petteri Taalas和第五段中的Taalas said可知，文章引用了世界气象组织官员的话，所以最可能出自电视或广播的专题节目，magazine有“(电视、广播)专题节目”的意思。\n\n答案：D",

      "text": "We moved into a new neighborhood in 1990.Andy was pretty much the first person we met. He came across the street to greet us. Having lived there since 1967, he was warm and kind, full of energy. He would introduce to us which bakery for cakes, which store for shopping and   even the occupations of everyone around us.\n\nAndy would proudly and regularly wear his veteran(老兵) cap and play music while doing yard work. More than anything, though, he delighted in talking about our kids as much as about his. We watched out for each other. He would keep an eye on our vegetable gardens when we went on vacation; we gave him some of our produce in return. Andy and I would also complain about the big trucks that used our streets as a shortcut. As more time went by, we didn't see him out  walking his small dog as often due to his health problem, and we'd help with clearing the snow in the winter. Those ties continued with time passing by.\n\nBut the real tie of our neighborhoods is their people—an Andy，or，in some cases，many Andys. Our neighborhoods are built on them，and  strengthened by their emotional ties.We are better for their presence，and worse for their absence.\n\nAndy died this month. I will miss him, more than he imagines.\n\n",

      "text": "Tobogganing，or sledding (乘雪橇)，likely comes before the colonization of North America.Records show that Canada's First Peoples used small sleds to transport their belongings and food between camps，Raymond Flower writes in The History of Skiing and Other Winter Sports.But modern­day sled races can trace their origins back to the Swiss Alps in the late 1800s when British tourists decided to race in wooden luges (a sled used by one person) that locals had used to travel through snow.The origin is debatable in snowy northern New York，however，where there's evidence that Albany held bobsled (a sled used by two or more people) races as early as 1885.\n\nWherever they began，sled races quickly became popular.The famous Cresta Run，named after the Swiss town near the base of its course，was built in 1885 using snowbanks.The first organized competition was in 1898，hosted by the first bobsled club in nearby St.Moritz (a city in Switzerland)．It was then that sledding began to separate from the luge to include two new sports: bob sledding，and skeleton sledding (俯式雪橇)．\n\nCresta Run is considered the birthplace of the skeleton，a particularly daring form of sledding.Unlike the luge，where competitors ride feet­first on a sled with metal runners，the skeleton sledding is a steel sled with a slim appearance.Riders lie down on the sled head­first，then drop suddenly down an ice track.Bobsledding，meanwhile，involves teams of two to four in which the person in front controls directions and the player in back brakes when needed.It earned its name after competitors started swinging back and forth to speed up the sled.\n\nBobsledding initially overtook skeleton sledding in popularity，becoming one of a handful of sports played at the first Winter Games in 1924.The skeleton sledding was limited to the Cresta Run for decades because other bob runs around the world were not built for the steel skeleton sled.But in the 1970s，adjustments were made to both the skeleton and bob runs in order to include the event at future winter games.\n\n【语篇解读】　本文是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了雪橇运动在瑞士的发展。\n\n1．What can we infer about Raymond Flower?\n\nA．He is a writer.\n\nB．He is good at sledding.\n\nC．He invented the sledding race.\n\nD．He set the first record of sledding.\n\n解析：推理判断题。根据第一段中的“Records show that Canada's First Peoples used small sleds to transport their belongings and food between camps，Raymond Flower writes in The History of Skiing and Other Winter Sports.”可以推断出，雷蒙德·弗拉沃是一位作家。\n\n答案：A\n\n2．How does skeleton sledding differ from the luge?\n\nA．Skeleton sledding runs on metal runners.\n\nB．Skeleton sledding doesn't have back brakes.\n\nC．Riders on skeleton sledding sled with their feet.\n\nD．Skeleton sledding needs players to lie down on it head­first.\n\n解析：细节理解题。根据第三段中的“Unlike the luge，where competitors ride feet­first on a sled with metal runners，the skeleton sledding is a steel sled with a slim appearance.Riders lie down on the sled head­first，then drop suddenly down an ice track.”可知，俯式雪橇与无舵雪橇的不同之处是，俯式雪橇需要运动员在滑行时头朝下躺在上面。\n\n答案：D\n\n3．What limited the popularity of skeleton sledding?\n\nA．Its special shape.\n\nB．Its speed.\n\nC．Its steel runners.\n\nD．Its unsuitable adjustments.\n\n解析：细节理解题。根据最后一段中的“The skeleton sledding was limited to the Cresta Run for decades because other bob runs around the world were not built for the steel skeleton sled.”可知，俯式雪橇数十年来受限于克雷斯塔滑道是因为其他地方的雪橇滑道不适合钢架的俯式雪橇，因此限制了俯式雪橇的普及的是它的钢骨架。\n\n答案：C\n\n4．What can be the best title for the text?\n\nA．Why Is Sledding So Popular?\n\nB．How Did Sledding Develop in Switzerland?\n\nC．What Are Sledding Adventures about?\n\nD．How Did People Kill Time in North America?\n\n解析：标题归纳题。通读全文，尤其是第二段可知，文章介绍了雪橇运动在瑞士的发展，因此B项是最佳标题。\n\n答案：B",

      "text": "Museums are centers filled with information designed to enlighten and educate the curious mind.Especially for children，museums introduce them to unknown worlds，inspire their imagination and provide them with valuable learning experiences.It's generally believed that museums only help fuel academic education.But in fact，they provide knowledge regarding all walks of life.\n\nMuseums offer children bigger connections and references to history than a traditional class.They play a huge role in impacting their historical knowledge and the innovation taking place before their eyes. Parents themselves don't have to be history lovers. Just reading out to them，encouraging them to ask questions and holding their attention.\n\nMuseums are a collection of resources that promote informal education. Individuals acquire values，knowledge，and skills that are not applicable to the only field but will aid them for a lifetime.A single visit to a museum near you will provide children with in­depth knowledge about different subjects that they can acquire slowly，for museums let you stay as long as you want.\n\nMuseums are well enough equipped to awaken curiosity in young minds，which in turn will lead to these children asking questions.Some of these questions may have immediate answers. Some of them might need a great deal of thought to answer and some of them might not have any answers at all.No matter what they asked，all of these questions must be equally encouraged and children must be given the confidence to find the answers to them on their own.\n\nMuseums have the ability to leave its visitors in awe of the huge amount of information it holds.They provide inspiration to young children via its resources that leave them fascinated about the night sky and the solar system，the skeletons that keep them thinking about life before them，the artworks that arouse the creative mind，etc. All in all，museums encourage children to dream and wonder.\n",

      "text": "A walk in the park may be just what the doctor ordered.A new program launched last month in Canada gives some doctors the option of providing patients with a free annual pass to the country's national parks as part of an effort to increase access to nature and the health benefits.\n\nPaRx，a health initiative launched by the BC Parks Foundation in 2019，partnered with Parks Canada to provide doctors across four provinces with an initial run of 100 passes that can be prescribed (开处方)．The program allows doctors to write more general prescriptions for time spent out in nature; two hours a week，at least 20 minutes at a time，is what PaRx director Dr.Melissa Lem suggests.\n\n“Given the growing body of evidence that indicates nature time can improve all kinds of different physical and mental health conditions，we're hoping that our PaRx program not only improves patient health，but reduces costs to the health­care system，and helps to grow the number of people who are more engaged environmental advocates，” said Prama Rahman，a coordinator for the BC Parks Foundation.\n\nDoctors have been catching on，instructing their patients to turn to nature to improve their health and they're getting creative in how they do it.Dr.Robert Zarr，a doctor based in Washington，began prescribing accessible outdoor activities for his young patients and even created a searchable online database of local parks to make it easier.\n\nBut getting outside isn't always as easy as it might sound.Income can affect one's access to nature，an issue that PaRx is trying to address in Canada.Doctors  utilizing  the new national parks pass program are urged to prioritize patients who might not otherwise be able to afford these passes.\n\nWhile only 100 adult passes，which give holders access to more than 80 national parks，historic sites and nature reserves，have initially been made available，organizers plan to routinely reassess this number as the program grows，the BC Parks Foundation told NPR.\n\n【语篇解读】　本文是一篇新闻报道。文章主要介绍了健康方案PaRx的目的及其在实施中遇到的问题。\n\n5．What is PaRx intended to do?\n\nA．Qualify doctors to prescribe.\n\nB．Give patients free access to parks.\n\nC．Promote free admission to parks.\n\nD．Advocate 20 minutes' walk a day.\n\n解析：细节理解题。根据第一段第二句“A new program launched last month in Canada gives some doctors the option of providing patients with a free annual pass to the country's national parks as part of an effort to increase access to nature and the health benefits.”及第二段第一句“PaRx，a health initiative launched by the BC Parks Foundation in 2019，partnered with Parks Canada to provide doctors across four provinces with an initial run of 100 passes that can be prescribed.”可知，PaRx这个方案是用来给患者发放免费公园通行证的。\n\n答案：B\n\n6．What does the underlined word “utilizing” in paragraph 5 probably mean?\n\nA．Financing.　　　　\tB．Setting up.\n\nC．Evaluating. \tD．Carrying out.\n\n解析：词义猜测题。根据画线词所在句“Doctors utilizing the new national parks pass program are urged to prioritize patients who might not otherwise be able to afford these passes.”中的后半部分可知，医生被要求给收入不高的患者优先发放免费通行证，由此可推知，医生首先得有这一项目的使用权才能给患者发放，因而画线词utilizing表示“使用”与carrying out“执行”意思相近。\n\n答案：D\n\n7．What can we infer from the last paragraph?\n\nA．The BC Parks Foundation is expanding rapidly.\n\nB．The program has signed up 80 national parks.\n\nC．More people will benefit from the program.\n\nD．Those living close to parks can gain priority.\n\n解析：推理判断题。根据最后一段内容可知，目前的通行证数量不多，但组织者会定期评估数据做出调整，由此推知，这样就会有越来越多的人因此受益。\n\n答案：C\n\n8．Which is the best title for the text?\n\nA．PaRx，a Nature Prescription Program\n\nB．BC Parks Foundation in Canada\n\nC．Year­long Passes to National Parks\n\nD．A New Study on Benefits of Walk\n\n解析：标题归纳题。本文主要介绍了PaRx健康方案的目的及实施中遇到的问题，故A项“PaRx，a Nature Prescription Program”可以概括文章内容，适合作为本文标题。\n\n答案：A\n\n",

      "text": "A letter written to a 12­year­old girl in Lithuania was delivered in December，almost 51 years after it was sent by a pen pal in Poland.“I thought that someone was  pranking  me，” said Genovefa Klonovska after being handed the letter，which included a handmade colored rose and two paper dolls.\n\nThe letter，together with 17 others，fell out of a ventilation hole (通风口) this summer，dirty and wrinkled，as a wall was taken down in a former post office on the suburb of Vilnius.Jurgis Vilnius，owner of the building immediately called the post office.“I'm so happy they got interested，” said he.\n\nStreet names and their numbering have changed in Vilnius，and post office workers spent months looking for the right houses and talking to current renters and neighbors，tracking down where the recipients moved to.Only five were found.In several cases children of late recipients were handed a lost letter.\n\n“We felt a moral duty to do this，” said Deimante Zebrauskaite，head of the customer experience department at Lithuania Post.\n\nOne lady compared the experience to receiving a message from a bottle thrown into the sea.People were emotional.“Some felt they saw a part of daily life of their deceased parents，” Zebrauskaite said.\n\nIn the letter to Klonovska，sent from Koezary in Poland and stamped in 1970，a girl named Ewa complains buses no longer reach her village，so she has to walk in minus 23 degree Celsius cold，and asks for pictures of actors.\n\nNow in her 60s，Klonovska has no memory of Ewa.She probably wrote Ewa after finding her address advertising for pen pals in a newspaper，and the relationship ceased after the letter got undelivered.\n\n“So good that the letter didn't matter much.The loss was not life­changing，” said Klonovska. “What if they delivered a lost letter from a suitor (求婚者) to his love，and their wedding never happened？”\n\n1．What does the underlined word “pranking” in paragraph 1 mean?\n\nA．Brightening.　　　　　\tB．Embarrassing.\n\n_C．Tricking. \tD．Pleasing.\n\n\n2．What happened to the letters in paragraph 2?\n\n_A．They were accidentally found.\n\nB．They remained well­preserved.\n\nC．They were delivered by the former post office.\n\nD．They were hidden by the owner of the building.\n\n\n3．Which of the following best describes the present post office in Vilnius?\n\nA．Generous. \t_B．Dutiful.\n\nC．Honest. \tD．Cautious.\n\n4．What can we learn from what Klonovska said?\n\nA．Klonovska refused a suitor.\n\nB．Klonovska stopped the wedding.\n\nC．The undelivered letter ruined the relationship.\n\n_D．The undelivered letter made little difference to her.\n",

      "text": "When Ken was in high school，he did well and had a strong sense of accomplishment.However，when he is in college，his grades are not so outstanding among academically gifted students much like himself，if not better.Often he feels depressed and is withdrawing from people and activities.Unfortunately，he is no exception. The literature generally has found that many of us tend to let our self­worth be contingent (依情况而定的)upon external events(such as academics and physical attractiveness)．When our self­worth depends on those，it's unstable. As a result，our feelings about ourselves can end up being in the hands of others.\n\nObviously，we all want to experience things that make us feel good.But when we have contingent self­worth，we might engage in activities that make us feel worthy while avoiding activities that make us feel unworthy. That may pose potential dangers. Instead of working hard to meet our goals，we'll try to avoid failure.And if we do fail one day，we might abandon our goals，lose motivation，or make excuses to help ourselves feel better.\n\nLet's cite some examples to further demonstrate that. If our self­worth is contingent upon being successful at work，we might only choose jobs that are easy.That way we never fail and ensure that we always know that we are worthy.Or，maybe we only think we're worthy if we weigh less than 50 kg.We might undereat or engage in unhealthy eating practices just to make sure that we feel good.\n\nSelf­worth is an important psychological construct that affects not only how we think about ourselves but it also has an impact on our psychological health and functioning.So，give up the idea of seeking approval from others.Instead，learn to base your self­worth on internal contingencies like virtues and faiths. Doing so reminds us to be fully aware of who we are.\n",

      "text": "\nOn a break from his studies in the MIT Media Lab, Anirudh Sharma traveled home to Mumbai, India. While there, he noticed that throughout the day his T­shirts were gradually gathering something that looked like  dirt.  “I realized  this  was  air pollution, or  sooty (烟尘覆盖的) particulate matter (PM), made of black particles released from exhaust (尾气) of vehicles，”  Sharma says.“This is a major health issue.” Soot consists of tiny black particles, about 2.5 micrometers or smaller, made of carbon produced by incomplete burning of fossil fuels.\n\nBack at MIT, Sharma set out to help solve this air­pollution issue. After years of research and development, Sharma's start­up Graviky Labs has developed technology that attaches to exhaust systems  of diesel  generators to  collect  particulate  matter.  Scientists  at  Graviky  then turn it into ink, called Air­Ink, for artists around the world. So far, the start­up has collected 1.6 billion micrograms of particulate matter. More than 200 gallons of Air­Ink have been harvested for a growing community of more than 1,000 artists, from Bangalore to Boston, Shanghai，and London.\n\nPosted all over Graviky Labs' social media platform page today are photos of art made from Air­Ink and paints, including street wall paintings, body art and clothing prints. At first, there was still no specific application for the ink. Then the start­up decided to find new ways to further spread its mission. It chose to do so through art. “Art helps us raise awareness about where the ink and paints come from. Air pollution knows no borders. Our ink sends a message that pollution is the one of the resources in our world that's the hardest to collect and use. But it can be done，”  Sharma says.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": " Life can take any turn at any time or movement. It is unpredictable.One truth about life is that we can't spend it alone to live the journey.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, my left leg was injured. The doctor declared it a serious injury, and I would be in bed for three months. As a full­time social worker, I hardly had time to visit my home. However, my broken leg stopped all my work, which was bad and also good, giving me an opportunity to spend time with myself and my family.\n\nI was upset. How would I spend three months in bed at home? Early in my injury and before my operation, there were so many ups and downs in my confidence. So many times, negative thoughts bothered me.\n\nI felt very depressed but each time I got support from my family and friends. I decided to change my lifestyle according to the situation. It was not so simple or easy. I began to practice thinking deeply in silence, read books, and talk with friends. I even planted various plants to help me heal. It was relaxing to water them.\n\nEventually, I am fully recovered，feeling relaxed. At the time of struggle and tough situations, we feel the need of someone who can spend time with us. Their kind presence gives us so much strength and support. They just meet in our heart and family, and just need our love and friendship.\n",

      "text": "\nBy morning, Arthur knew what he had to do after sitting all night thinking. He went out and glanced again at his motorcycle. There was no hiding the broken front lamp and the dent(凹痕) on the side. Arthur let out a sigh and went to run errands (跑腿) for his mother first.\n\nIt was late morning before Arthur was free to carry out his plan. He went toward Jay Pritchett's house. When the door opened, Arthur cleared his throat and said，“I'm so sorry. I carelessly knocked into your parked car.” Jay looked at the 17­year­old youth, surprised. Arthur continued, “Sorry for not telling you timely. I was too frightened.”\n\nJay was silent for a minute before saying in a kind voice, “You think it is the right thing to cover up for your brother？” Arthur went pale, wide­eyed. Jay explained that his brother had admitted how he had ridden Arthur's motorcycle and lost control， resulting in the accident. Arthur asked anxiously， “Will he be arrested？” “No, just a small dent.” Seeing Arthur's relieved expression, he went on, “I hope，however， your brother will learn from this. As for you, remember that it is unwise to hide the truth.”\n\nArthur thanked him and set off home. He was proud of his brother's courage in admitting everything. He knew he could look forward to a good night's rest.\n",

      "text": "There is a time when many Americans question whether a college degree is worth its cost. However，a recent study found Americans who completed college or university are more likely to have friends and are less lonely than those who only finished high school.\n\nDaniel Cox，director of the Survey Center on American Life，said that in general Americans are experiencing a “friend recession”，meaning a decline in their number of friends. Cox noted “Americans have fewer close friends today than we did in the early 1990s.But men and those without a college degree are particularly affected because they seem to have experienced a much more dramatic decline over that period”．\n\nThe Center questioned 5,054 people this past summer. It found Americans with a college degree feel more socially connected and are more active in their communities than people who didn't go to college. As a result，those who completed college report feeling less lonely.\n\nPrevious research showed that Americans who didn't go to college are less likely to marry. A study found that college­educated women are much more likely to get married than women who dropped out of high school. Another study of people born between 1957 and 1964 found that both men and women who didn't finish high school are less likely to marry than those with more education.\n\nToday,65 percent of college­educated Americans over age 25 are married. About 50 percent of people with a high school diploma, or who dropped out of high school，are married.Those numbers were different in 1990, when marriage rates among the college graduates were at 69 percent，compared with 63 percent for those who did not go to college, says a Pew research report.\n\nThe American Community Life Survey found around 1 in 10 college graduates say they have no close social connections. That number rises among Americans without a degree，where almost 1 in 4 say they have no close friends.\n\n\n",

      "text": "Sometime in the early 1960s，a significant thing happened in Sydney，Australia.The city discovered its harbor.Then，one after another，Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there—broad parks，superb beaches，and a culturally diverse population.But it is the harbor that makes the city.\n\nAndrew Reynolds，a cheerful fellow in his early 30s，pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living.I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor.After our third run Andrew shut down the engine，and we went our separate ways—he for a lunch break，I to explore the city.\n\n“I'll miss these old boats，” he said as we parted.\n\n“How do you mean？” I asked.\n\n“Oh，they're replacing them with catamarans.Catamarans are faster，but they're not so elegant，and they're not fun to pilot.But that's progress，I guess.”\n\nEverywhere in Sydney these days，change and progress are the watchwords (口号)，and traditions are increasingly rare.Shirley Fitzgerald，the city's official historian，told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s，Sydney swept aside much of its past，including many of its finest buildings.“Sydney is confused about itself，” she said.“We can't seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one.It's a conflict that we aren't getting any better at resolving (解决)．”\n\nOn the other hand，being young and old at the same time has its attractions.I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony.“Many people say that we lack culture in this country，” he told me.“What people forget is that the Italians，when they came to Australia，brought 2,000 years of their culture，the Greeks some 3,000 years，and the Chinese more still.We've got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country.It's a pretty hard combination to beat.”\n\nHe is right，but I can't help wishing they would keep those old ferries.\n\n\n",

      "text": "\n5G mobile technology has officially begun rolling out across the globe，which indicates a dynamic acceleration (加速) in our world of connectivity.It promotes operational cooperation tourism hasn't experienced before. It also transforms the travel experience.\nThis is perceived from both the way the industry operates and the side of the traveler.\n\n5G opens up a new way of accessing information and delivering business value. It's expected to offer organizations a wireless network that transforms the way people and machines use data.Unlike previous network generations,5G is now being seen as not just a consumer platform，but a primary communications platform that can also provide cloud connectivity and edge processing that can offer real­time business insights and automated responses，and eventually integrate the billions of Internet of things devices and data that are available.\n\nAs travel companies have transformed their operations with new digital systems，their focus has moved from the technology itself to the improved business outcomes and enhanced guest and passenger experiences driven by the technology. 5G's capabilities can support that change. With advanced connectivity speeds and low latency(延时)，guests can share their personal data to receive custom recommendations from travel companies in real time that should provide meaningful experiences. Virtual experiences give guests an early taste of the destination. For example，guests can involve themselves in viewing rooms and hotel facilities，or preview local attractions as they plan their trips.\n\nTo prepare to roll out this new technology，travel companies should ensure they have a thorough understanding of their guests' expectations on what makes a first­rank travel experience. Then they should find ways to adapt their processes and services to meet them.\n\n\n",

      "text": "Great inventors like Thomas Edison have impacted people's lives with their inventions.While their contributions are certainly valuable，the following amazing inventions were actually created by children!\n\n## The trampoline\n\nTrampolines are great for both fun and exercise，but they are a fairly recent invention.In the 1930s，George Nissen was inspired to make a bouncy “net” after seeing a circus performance.He thought it more entertaining for performers to continue bouncing instead of landing in a net.So，at the age of 16，he made it by stretching thick cloth in a metal frame.\n\n## The Popsicle\n\nCold weather led to the creation of a delicious invention—the Popsicle.Frank Epperson was just 11 years old when he accidentally created his first Popsicle.He was making himself a soda drink and left his glass outside overnight.When he found it in the morning，it had frozen solid with the stir (搅拌)stick still in the glass.And the first Popsicle was born.\n\n## Braille\n\nThree­year­old Louis Braille experienced a serious eye injury that blinded him in both eyes.He struggled to read by moving his fingers across raised letters，but that proved very difficult.At the age of twelve，Louis learned about a communication system where messages could be read silently with fingertips.He changed it and created Braille.It's now used around the world!\n\n## BEACON\n\nWhen Hannah Herbst was just 14 years old，she was named America's Top Young Scientist for inventing a device called BEACON.After receiving a letter from her Ethiopian pen pal，Hannah was inspired to create a device that could convert the energy from ocean waves into electricity which she hopes will help people without easy access to electricity.\n\n【语篇解读】　本文是一篇应用文。文章主要介绍了几项青少年的发明\n\n1．Which of the inventions greatly benefits the blind?\n\nA．The trampoline.\n\nB．The Popsicle.\n\nC．Braille.\n\nD．BEACON.\n\n解析：细节理解题。根据题干“Which of the inventions greatly benefits the blind？”可锁定第四段中的“Three­year­old Louis Braille experienced a serious eye injury that blinded him in both eyes.”，由此可知，Braille盲文使盲人受 益。\n\n答案：C\n\n2．Who was awarded a national title for his/her invention?\n\nA．George Nissen.\n\nB．Frank Epperson.\n\nC．Louis Braille.\n\nD．Hannah Herbst.\n\n解析：细节理解题。 根据题干中的a national title可以定位到BEACON中的“When Hannah Herbst was just 14 years old，she was named America's Top Young Scientist for inventing a device called BEACON.”。故D项正确。\n\n答案：D\n\n3．What do the child inventors have in common?\n\nA．They were all awarded for their amazing inventions.\n\nB．They all made improvements on previous inventions.\n\nC．They were all teenagers when they made their inventions.\n\nD．They all invented great things that influence people's lives.\n\n解析：推理判断题。根据第一段中的have impacted people's lives和the following amazing inventions并通过第二段至第五段可知，孩子们的四种发明——蹦床、棒冰、盲文、海浪发电装置都很棒，它们影响了人们的生活。故D项正确。\n\n答案：D\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "A study of teenage girls' selfie­taking (自拍) behavior found that taking and sharing selfies on social media is not linked to poor body image or appearance concerns.However，when adolescent girls spend too much time struggling over which photo of themselves to post，or rely heavily on editing apps to alter their images，there may be cause for concern.\n\nThe study，by researchers at the University of Arizona(UA)，found that selfie editing and time invested in creating and selecting the perfect selfie were both related to self­objectification，which led to body shame，appearance anxiety and more negative appearance evaluations in teen girls.“Self­objectification is the idea that you come to think of yourself as an external object to be viewed by other people，” said senior study author Jennifer Aubrey，an associate professor at the UA.\n\nBased on a study of 278 teenage girls，“Our main finding was that we really shouldn't be too worried about kids who take selfies and share them; that's not where the negative effects come from.It's the investment and the editing that yielded negative effects，” Aubrey said.“Selfie editing and selfie investment predicted self­objectification，and girls who self­objectify were more likely to feel shameful about their bodies or anxious about their appearance.”\n\n“Self­objectification is the pathway to so many things in adolescence that we want to prevent，” Aubrey said.“So，interventions really should focus on how we can encourage girls to develop an awareness of themselves that doesn't only depend on what they look like to other people.” The researchers said parents and caregivers of adolescent girls should be aware that if a teen seems to be obsessed (痴迷的)，it might be time for a talk.\n\nThe researchers also note that there can be different motivations for sharing selfies.“Selfies are a part of the media landscape，but you should post them for reasons other than trying to get people to admire your appearance or your body，” Aubrey said.With an estimated 93 million selfies taken each day，they aren't going away anytime soon，nor should they.The important thing to remember is: Selfies aren't bad.Just don't obsess.\n\n【语篇解读】　本文是一篇说明文。很多青春期的女孩沉迷于自拍，这很可能导致她们对自己的身体感到羞耻和外貌焦虑。科学家们对此进行了研究并鼓励女孩们形成健康的自我意识。\n\n4．What behavior of adolescent girls may cause concern?\n\nA．Taking selfies.\n\nB．Caring about their images.\n\nC．Sharing selfies on social media.\n\nD．Overusing editing apps to beautify their images.\n\n解析：细节理解题。根据第一段最后一句可知，过度使用编辑应用程序来美化照片可能会引起担忧。\n\n答案：D\n\n5．From the text，what can we learn about self­objectification?\n\nA．It predicts selfie investment.\n\nB．It is linked to selfie obsession.\n\nC．It prevents problems in adolescence.\n\nD．It contributes to objective evaluation.\n\n解析：推理判断题。根据第二段中的“The study，by researchers at the University of Arizona (UA)，found that selfie editing and time invested in creating and selecting the perfect selfie were both related to self­objectification”和第三段中的“Selfie editing and selfie investment predicted self­objectification”可推知，自我物化与沉迷于自拍有关。\n\n答案：B\n\n6．What should interventions center on?\n\nA．When to have a talk with teen girls.\n\nB．When to end selfie­taking behavior.\n\nC．How to help form a healthy self­awareness.\n\nD．How to prevent teenage girls' craze for selfies.\n\n解析：细节理解题。根据第四段中的“So，interventions really should focus on how we can encourage girls to develop an awareness of themselves that doesn't only depend on what they look like to other people.”可知，干预应以如何帮助青少年女孩形成健康的自我意识为中心。\n\n答案：C\n\n7．From which is the text probably taken?\n\nA．A travel brochure.\n\nB．A science newspaper.\n\nC．A psychology textbook.\n\nD．An entertainment magazine.\n\n解析：推理判断题。通读全文可知，文章介绍了与青少年心理健康相关的科学研究，再结合文章最后的建议“The important thing to remember is：Selfies aren't bad.Just don't obsess.”可推知，文章很可能来自一份科学报。\n\n答案：B",

      "text": "At just 19 years old，Akiša Peters teaches at the Sisseton Wahpeton Tribal College.He specializes in a language that is thousands of years old，the Dakota language，spoken by the Dakota people.\n\n“The Dakota language is ‘the most important aspect' of Dakota culture.Without it，our Dakota culture would no longer exist！” Peters claimed.“I was lucky to grow up around many first­language Dakota speakers.But now the elderly continually passed away and at the end of their lives，they just wanted to know their families would continue to have the language.One of the problems our people have is finding ways to get at­length and consistent exposure to the language.”\n\nAside from instructing at the college level，Peters uses social media to share videos that integrate humor，culture，and basic­level conversation to help teach Dakota.In his free time，he visits Dakota elders.He also started an online group of youth to converse and share the knowledge of the language in a safe and supportive space.\n\nAkiša Peters wants to tell the youth that if they want to learn their own language，sit with their elders and learn from them.Endless vocabulary sheets could discourage them from learning.Standards created by non­speakers could also do that.“Within the next decade，I assume，me，my colleagues，and other Dakota­learning relatives will have children and start a new generation of Dakota.I also hope my brothers and sisters will take the path we laid out for them and continue to learn and speak Dakota.On my reservation there are numerous young people working on the comeback of the language.I'm hopeful because I'm definitely not alone，” Akiša Peters told Teen vogue.\n\n\n5．Why does Akiša Peters teach the Dakota language?\n\nA．To enrich his experience.\n\nB．To record its written form.\n\n_C．To prevent it dying out.\n\nD．To make it known globally.\n\n\n6．What can we say about Akiša Peters according to paragraph 3?\n\nA．Learned.  \t_B．Creative.\n\nC．Approachable.  \tD．Cooperative.\n\n\n7．What does Akiša Peters expect the young people to do?\n\nA．Deal with vocabulary sheets.\n\nB．Sustain the given standards.\n\n_C．Communicate with their elders.\n\nD．Learn from their teachers.\n\n\n8．Which section of a website is the text probably taken from?\n\nA．Research.

      "text": "As a young boy，I loved being active.All I really wanted to do was to put on my football shoes and play out with my friends.As I've got older，my love for physical activity hasn't declined.This is why I was so eager to be involved in the Creating Active Schools framework as a PE teacher.\n\nIn the early stages of my time at Peel Park Primary，my two main aims were to reform the PE course and to increase our participation in competitive sports.We achieved these successfully in a short time.\n\nJust as I'll never love art，many of our pupils will never love football or tennis.That's why finding a way to move，which works for each child，is vital.What we can do is get opportunities for every child to love being physically active.\n\nWe therefore opened our own school Bike Library.We have already received many rental requests.We also thought about how to arrange the school day，allowing all children to access our equipment freely and easily.Besides，we also have a “PA” lesson which has a total free choice for the children.They can swing on the trees，go on the bikes and play games with their friends.This change from thinking has improved participation in the “traditional PE” from pupils，who typically didn't love sports.A win­win situation!\n\nNow I'm looking forward to our next step on this journey to improving pupils' lives.The potential of this project as it expands，is huge.",

      "text": "Do we still need cash? The days of holding notes in our hands may be numbered. The advancement of technology and the increase of new electronic and mobile devices in today's world are set to revolutionize how we make payments. With a click of a mobile phone app，our entire wealth is literally at our fingertips. As digital forms are increasingly replacing cash payments，some think that we should become fully cash­free. However，I do not believe we should move towards a completely cash­free society.\n\nOne of the main concerns of a cashless world is the risk of a cheat and ridiculously，the inconvenience that follows. The instant content that accompanies cashless transactions (交易) could be compromised by online security issues. Technology experts argue that our current state of technology is unable to provide a secure cashless environment that could prevent people from accessing the system illegally and abusing the personal data. In addition，many online shopping sites lack strong systems that would protect their customers' personal information. Occasionally，when an account is “locked” due to a suspected cheating activity, having cash in hand becomes critical. In a cashless society，a victim of cheating would find himself locked out of his account and unable to have access to his money until the case is solved. Going cash­free causes great inconvenience in this case.\n\nAnother reason is that mankind might potentially become less thrifty (节俭的). Paying in cash causes a psychological pain on consumers so that they are more cautious in their spending. As it is，cashless payments have already eased that pain somewhat. Thus，an even more careless digital payment could make us much less thrifty.\n\nThe idea of a cashless society is a very real，or even an exciting one. However，to safeguard the interests of all users，it is better to soften our enthusiasm—perhaps to be a less­cash society rather than a completely cashless one is a better option.\n\n",

      "text": "In some snow­covered villages in Altay district of Xinjiang，it's common in winter to see local herdsmen (牧民) with planks attached to their feet climb the snowy slopes without any other form of assistance.The pair of planks are wrapped with horsehide (马皮)，which serves a double purpose.Remarkably，the horsehide not only can provide friction to prevent skiers from slipping while going up the hills，but also helps them slide more smoothly down the hills.\n\nAccording to rock carvings uncovered in the area by archaeologists，such skis have served for around 12,000 years as a means of transportation for the snowfield people of Altay，especially those who had to travel a long way in the snow to herd animals or hunt.The fur skis gradually lost their popularity in recent decades after paved roads linked houses to the outside world.However，in response to the nation's goal of brightening up grassroots enthusiasm for ice and snow sports，Altay plans to protect and promote its skiing culture and better pass along its skiing tradition to future generations.\n\nSilambek Sakish,67，a herdsman in the village of Altay，began to learn the craft at the age of 15 from his father.He would cut high­quality pine into a plank and then bend the plank's front end after the wood was heated in a fire.Wrapping the plank with horsehide was the last step.\n\nSakish was honored as an heritor of the craft of making fur skis in 2010，which had been assigned as an intangible (非物质) cultural heritage of Xinjiang.His works are exhibited in ski places，airports and train stations across Altay and also at the display center for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics to promote the district's deep historical connection to skiing.More young people have come to him to learn the craft，and his youngest son，who is 31，has followed in his footsteps to carry on the tradition.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Many people think that there should be some sort of universal service around cash，forcing banks to provide it and sellers to accept it.I disagree，but I do understand why they think that forcing the additional costs associated with cash on financial institutions and merchants seems appealing.\n\nOne of their arguments is that cash is a necessary fallback，the only payment method that society can depend on in the event of nuclear war or natural disaster and therefore businesses should be forced to keep the ability to distribute and collect notes and coins.They think that cash is the backup in a disaster.It really isn't.When things go really wrong，it is the people who keep their money in cash who suffer the most.\n\nRemember the Japanese disaster of a decade back，where following a severe earthquake off the northeast coast of Japan's Honshu Island in 2011，a huge tsunami (海啸) towering a hundred feet above the ground went crashing into cities，towns and villages destroying more than 500 square kilometers.Since Japan remains a cash­based society and a great many people keep their savings in cash in their homes，the disaster led to the unusual phenomenon of safes and cash washing up on beaches.Yasuo Kimura，a former bank employee then aged 67，said that he had many friends who lost everything.“I had tried to convince them to put their money in a bank，” he said.“They always thought it was safer to keep it at home.”\n\nAnother argument they make is that electronic payment can be bad for privacy，making cash remain the best backup.They ask “How do you stop data thieves and data brokers from monitoring your buying history？” and suggest paying in cash is the answer.Personally，I think using privacy­enhancing (增强隐私的) technologies when making electronic payments is a better answer，but that's a discussion for another day.\n\n5．What makes many people think it necessary to force cash service on banks?\n\nA．The duty of banks.\n\n_B．The reliability of cash.\n\nC．The need to cut costs.\n\nD．The demand from sellers.\n\n\n6．What was one of the results of the Japanese disaster in 2011?\n\nA．The quake destroyed over 500 square kilometers.\n\nB．100 towers were swallowed by the tsunami.\n\nC．Japanese started to keep money in banks.\n\n_D．Many Japanese lost their backup money.\n\n\n7．What does the author think of electronic payment?\n\nA．It is not good for privacy.\n\n_B．It still leaves much to be desired.\n\nC．It is safer than cash payment.\n\nD．It often falls into the wrong hands.\n\n\n8．What can be the best title for the text?\n\nA．Is E­payment Safe?\n\nB．Lessons from a Natural Disaster\n\n_C．Is Cash the Backup?\n\nD．Appeal of Universal Cash Service\n",

      "text": "Edward O.  Wilson,  known as  “ant man”，  was born on June  10,  1929,  in Birmingham, Alabama. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was moved frequently throughout his childhood. Wilson grew up exploring the forests and wildlife. One of these adventures left him partly blind, but they also set off his lifelong fascination with ants and their social structures.\n\nWilson earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Alabama. In 1955, he received his Ph.D. from Harvard and worked there until retirement.\n\nWilson's early study of ants led to his first major discovery in 1959: how ants communicate through the release of chemical signals.\n\nLater, in 1990, Wilson and German biologist Bert Hölldobler published their Pulitzer­winning The Ants. It detailed the insects' social structure that was both valued by scholars and accessible to general readers.\n\nAnother of Wilson's major works started in the early 1960s when he teamed up with Robert MacArthur. The pair published The Theory of Island Biogeography, where they sought to explain why different places have different numbers of species.\n\nWhat many consider to be Wilson's most important contributions to evolutionary biology came in 1975 when he published Sociobiology:  The New Synthesis. The work explored the genetic roots of animal behavior and argued that genes shaped human behavior.\n\nWilson faced accusations for these ideas but his work finally largely proved true. In 1978, his ideas on the role biology plays in human culture peaked in On Human Nature, which won him a Pulitzer in 1979.\n\nWilson published more than 400 scientific papers and 30 books. These accomplishments offered him a type of superstar status, but friends and colleagues said the polite Southerner remained down to earth. “Professor Wilson really listened to and engaged with whomever he was interacting with，”said Corrie S. Moreau, who was one of Wilson's final advisees.\n",

      "text": "\nA wearable interactive display made of a flexible，breathable electronic fabric can display simple maps and text messages，potentially for use in future smart clothing，a research group reports in their latest paper.\n\nPrevious research has developed flexible thin­film displays that are rollable，foldable and stretchable.However，such electronics have not yet been successfully integrated into clothing.This is because it has proven challenging to design fabric displays that are both durable over time and easy to  assemble  over a large area.\n\nNow，Chinese scientists have woven bands of a new fabric display roughly 6 m long by 25 cm wide.To make the new fabric，polymer scientists Chen Peining and Peng Huisheng at Fudan University in Shanghai and their colleagues weave electrically transparent fibers into a flexible，breathable fabric.The fabric is about as bright as the average flat­screen TV.The researchers noted their prototype (雏形) was also significantly more durable than conventional flexible thin­film displays，making it more suitable for practical use.One likely application for this is wearable displays.The researchers integrated a touch­sensitive 16­button fabric keyboard，solar­energy­harvesting threads and battery fibers into their fabric to add interactivity and a power supply.They added electronics to wirelessly link it to a smartphone via a Bluetooth connection so users could send and receive messages on their sleeves，as well as see their real­time locations on a map.\n\nIn the future，smart clothing might help display messages from people with voice，speech and language problems.And it might even work in concert with devices that can decode (译解) complex brain waves to figure out what these people would like to say but cannot.However，“putting displays with 36 volts (伏特) directly on the body may potentially be a concern，” cautioned Bao，chemical engineer at Stanford University in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Popularization has in some cases changed the original meaning of emotional (情感的) intelligence.Many people now misunderstand emotional intelligence as almost everything desirable in a person's makeup that cannot be measured by an IQ test，such as character，motivation，confidence，mental stability，optimism and “people skills”. Research has shown that emotional skills may contribute to some of these qualities，but most of them move far beyond skill­based emotional intelligence.\n\nWe prefer to describe emotional intelligence as a specific set of skills that can be used for either good or bad purposes.The ability to accurately understand how others are feeling may be used by a doctor to find how best to help her patients，while a cheater might use it to control potential victims.Being emotionally intelligent does not necessarily make one a moral person.\n\nAlthough popular beliefs regarding emotional intelligence run far ahead of what research can reasonably support，the overall effects of the publicity have been more beneficial than harmful.The most positive aspect of this popularization is a new and much needed emphasis (重视) on emotion by employers，educators and others interested in promoting social well­being.The popularization of emotional intelligence has helped both the public and researchers reevaluate the functionality of emotions and how they serve people adaptively in everyday life.\n\nAlthough the continuing popular appeal of emotional intelligence is desirable，we hope that such attention will excite a greater interest in the scientific and scholarly study of emotion.It is our hope that in coming decades，advances in science will offer new perspectives (视角) from which to study how people manage their lives.Emotional intelligence，with its focus on both head and heart，may serve to point us in the right direction.\n\n\n5．What is a common misunderstanding of emotional intelligence?\n\nA．It can be measured by an IQ test.\n\nB．It helps to exercise a person's mind.\n\nC．It includes a set of emotional skills.\n\n_D．It refers to a person's positive qualities.\n\n\n6．Why does the author mention “doctor” and “cheater” in paragraph 2?\n\nA．To explain a rule.\n\n_B．To clarify a concept.\n\nC．To present a fact.\n\nD．To make a prediction.\n\n\n7．What is the author's attitude to the popularization of emotional intelligence?\n\n_A．Favorable. \tB．Intolerant.\n\nC．Doubtful. \tD．Unclear.\n\n\n8．What does the last paragraph mainly talk about concerning emotional intelligence?\n\nA．Its appeal to the public.\n\n_B．Expectations for future studies.\n\nC．Its practical application.\n\nD．Scientists with new perspectives.\n",

      "text": "According to the statistics shared by UNESCO，at least 43% of the total languages that are estimated as being spoken across the world are in danger of extinction.Moreover，many languages around the world have less than 1,000 speakers now.Linguists (语言学家) and researchers believe that by the end of the century，at least half of the world's languages will have died.This is troublesome，given that cultural identity and languages go hand in hand.\n\nLanguage activists and people who speak these endangered languages are fighting back tooth and nail.Scientists believe that digitalization might be our only hope to preserve some of these quickly disappearing languages in the online world.\n\nFor instance，Oxford University Press launched Oxford Global Languages a few years ago.It is an initiative that boosts “digitally underrepresented” languages.They are focused on promoting languages that might have close to a million speakers worldwide，yet have little or no online presence.Therefore，they have been creating digital dictionaries as a fundamental building block to help preserve them.\n\nThere have been countless other projects like this with the same aim.Another is the Rosetta Project，which aims to create a handheld digital library that will carry more than 1,500 languages.It will be appropriately sized to fit nicely into our hands，and will come with around 13,000 pages of information.It will also have a high life expectancy of anywhere between 2,000 and 10,000 years.Initiatives like these have as their primary objective to ensure the preservation of local languages long after their speakers have died.\n\nCountless languages are dying every day，and they will continue to  perish  as the remaining speakers die.Of course，we cannot merely rely on digitization to deal with worldwide language loss.However，it is a step in the right direction.These digital tools offer endangered languages an opportunity to bounce back and survive.\n\n\n1．What does the data in paragraph 1 mainly show?\n\n_A．Many languages are endangered.\n\nB．Culture determines language evolution.\n\nC．Human development results in fewer languages.\n\nD．Many linguists attempt to protect threatened languages.\n\n\n2．What does Oxford Global Languages try to do?\n\nA．Promote online courses of local languages.\n\nB．Publish paper dictionaries of global languages.\n\nC．Increase dying language speakers to a million.\n\n_D．Make certain languages available in digital form.\n\n\n3．What can we learn about the digital library to be created by the Rosetta Project?\n\nA．It is portable but has a short life.\n\nB．It is sponsored by Oxford University Press.\n\n_C．It provides protection for linguistic diversity.\n\nD．It contains automatically updated information.\n\n4．Which of the following can replace the underlined word “perish” in the last paragraph?\n\nA．Be enriched.\n_B．Be lost.\nC．Be acquired.  \nD．Be invented\n",

      "text": "If you're an un­decider，even the simplest decisions can make your pulse race.And big, life­changing choices can cause a state of breaking down.Here are some strategies for spending less time worrying about decisions.\n\n## Go for being good enough\n\nSince perfectionism and indecision often go hand in hand, you should be moving from a mindset that “only the best will do” to “being good enough is good enough”. It helps to reflect on your original goal. Did you begin the exhausting online shopping to find a toaster that could clean itself, roast carrots and also charge your cell phone? Or were you just looking for something that would brown your bread？Remembering your purpose can simplify the process.\n\n## Outsource (交外办理) decisions\n\nResearch has shown that choices weaken the willpower and lead to decision fatigue (疲劳). That's why indecisive people are advised to pick their “battles”．In other words, be choosy about choosing.When it comes to wine, for example, all I want is a good glass with dinner.So rather than studying which to choose, I leave the decision to my local wine store，asking it to send me a case of surprises once in a while.\n\n## The 90 percent rule\n\nWhen a yes­or­no decision has many pros and cons, try the “90 percent rule”. This involves evaluating an opportunity on a scale from 0 to 100. If your interest falls anywhere below 90 percent, reduce its score to zero and reject it.Think about how you'd feel if you scored 65 points on some test.Why would you deliberately choose to feel that way about an important choice in your life?\n\n## Cut through the fog\n\nIf you're deciding whether to move across the country, imagine you've asked your best friend to choose for you.On the big day, she hands you an envelope；inside, it announces you're leaving next month. Do you feel excited? Or disappointed? Using thought experiments to separate important variables can help you cut through the fog to see clarity\n",

      "text": "Space tourism is the term used to describe space travel for recreational or leisure purposes.What was once only a dream，as described in A Space Odyssey by Arthur C．Clarke，is now becoming a reality.\n\nFuturologists attempt to make predictions of what life will be like in the future.After the first man landed on the moon，they thought that hotels would be built on the moon by the year 2000.They also considered the possibility that，in the 21st century，families might go for a holiday on the moon.Neither of these predictions have come true yet—but the rapid development of technology may mean these predictions are possible in the years to come.\n\nSpace Adventures is currently the only company to have succeeded in sending paying passengers into space.It worked with the Federal Space Agency of Russia and Rocket and Space Corporation Energia to provide flights for the world's first private space explorers.Each paid over $20 million for their 10­day trip to the International Space Station.\n\nFollowing successful explorations into space，other companies are now considering the possibility of enabling tourists to visit space.To make it affordable，suborbital space travel is being considered by some companies，like Virgin Galactic.Passengers would be transported to a height of between 100 and 160 km above earth，experience 3－6 minutes of weightlessness and a view of the stars，then come back down to earth.This is expected to cost around $200,000 per person.\n\nWhile it could be an enriching experience，there are some disadvantages.Many critics say that a huge growth in the spaceflight industry could drastically speed up the process of global warming.The ozone layer would be damaged further and the polar regions would suffer.In addition，space travel is only really affordable for the super­rich，though Virgin Galactic claims to be “opening space to the rest of us”．\n\n\n\n1．What do you know about space tourism?\n\nA．It is nothing but a dream.\n\nB．It's only in some fairy tales.\n\n_C．It's a sightseeing tour in space.\n\nD．It's a scientific expedition.\n\n\n\n2．What is paragraph 2 mainly about?\n\nA．The future life on the moon.\n\nB．Landing on the moon in 1969.\n\n_C．Predictions about trips to the moon.\n\nD．The history of the moon exploration.\n\n\n\n3．Why is suborbital space travel considered possible?\n\n_A．It's cheaper.　　　　\tB．It's safer.\n\nC．It's greener. \tD．It's convenient.\n\n\n\n4．What is some critics' major concern about space tourism?\n\nA．Its safety.\n\n_B．Environmental effect.\n\nC．Social equality.\n\nD．Its expense.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 1\nA Puma at large\n\nPumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.\nThe hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of \"cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 10\nThe loss of the Titanic\n\nThe great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1,316 passengers and crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At the time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments. Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.\nFour days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy water of the North Atlantic, huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense walk of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so faint that no one though that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded!

Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty. The hardened professional smuggler, on the other hand, is never troubled by such feelings, even if he has five hundred gold watches hidden in his suitcase. When I returned form abroad recently, a particularly officious young Customs Officer clearly regarded me as a smuggler.\n'Have you anything to declare?' he asked, looking me in the eye.\n'No', I answered confidently.\n'Would you mind unlocking this suitcase please?'\n'Not at all,' I answered.\nThe Officer went through the case with great care. All the thing I had packed so carefully were soon in a dreadful mess. I felt sure I would never be able to close the case again. Suddenly, I saw the Officer's face light up. He had spotted a tiny bottle at the bottom of my case and he pounced on it with delight.\n'Perfume, eh?' he asked sarcastically. 'You should have declared that. Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'\n'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's hair gel.' Then I added with a smile, 'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'\nAs I expected, he did not believe me.\n'Try it!' I said encouragingly.\nThe officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.\n",

They were taking a badly damaged boat from the Virgin Islands to Miami to have it repaired. During the journey, their boat began to sink. They quickly loaded a small rubber dinghy with food, matches, and cans of beer and rowed for a few miles across the Caribbean until they arrived at a tiny coral island. There were hardly any trees on the island and there was no water, but this did not prove to be a problem. The men collected rainwater in the rubber dinghy. As they had brought a spear gun with them, they had plenty to eat. They caught lobster and fish every day��and, as one of them put it 'ate like kings'. When a passing tanker rescued them five days later, both men were genuinely sorry that they had to leave.\n",

One evening, however, the lamb was missing. The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.\nWhen Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened. Dimitri at once set out to find the thief. He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village. After telling several of his friends about the theft, Dimitri found out that his neighbour, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb. Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb. He told him he had better return it or he would call the police. Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard. It was true that he had just bought a lamb, he explained, but his lamb was black. Ashamed of having acted so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him. While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.

Though Verrazano is by no means considered to be a great explorer, his name will probably remain immortal, for on November 21st, 1964, the longest suspension bridge in the world was named after him.\nThe Verrazano Bridge, which was designed by Othmar Ammann, joins Brooklyn to Staten Island. It has a span of 4,260 feet. The bridge is so long that the shape of the earth had to be taken into account by its designer. Two great towers support four huge cables. The towers are built on immense underwater platforms make of steel and concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These alone took sixteen months to build. Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire. It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity. However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge. Despite its immensity, it is both simple and elegant, fulfilling its designer's dream to create 'an enormous object drawn as faintly as possible'.\n",

We have got quite used to them. Some so-called 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.\nIn spite of this, some people -- including myself -- were surprise by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture. The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said: 'Do not touch the exhibits. Some of them are dangerous!' The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture. Oddly shaped forms that are suspended form the ceiling and move in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody. These objects, however, were different. Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres. The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time. In the centre of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights. These lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad. Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily. It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic equipment. These peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally, but to give them electric shocks as well!\n",

At first she decided to go to the police, but fearing that she would never see Rastus again -- the letter had made that quite clear -- she changed her mind. She withdrew $1000 from her bank and followed the kidnapper's instructions. The next morning, the box had disappeared but Mrs. Ramsay was sure that the kidnapper would keep his word. Sure enough, Rastus arrived punctually at seven o'clock that evening. He looked very well though he was rather thirsty, for he drank half a bottle of milk.

Because of this, they were known as 'prizefighters'. However, boxing was very crude, for these were no rules and a prizefighter could be seriously injured or even killed during a match.\nOne of the most colourful figures in boxing history was Daniel Mendoza, who was born in 1764. The use of gloves was not introduced until 1860, when the Marquis of Queensberry drew up the first set of rules. Though he was technically a prizefighter, Mendoza did much to change crude prizefighting into a sport, for he brought science to the game. In this day, Mendoza enjoyed tremendous popularity. He was adored by rich and poor alike.\nMendoza rose to fame swiftly after a boxing match when he was only fourteen years old. This attracted the attention of Richard Humphries who was then the most eminent boxer in England. He offered to train Mendoza and his young pupil was quick to learn. In fact, Mendoza soon became so successful that Humphries turned against him. The two men quarrelled bitterly and it was clear that the argument could only be settled by a fight. A match was held at Stilton, where both men fought for an hour. The public bet a great deal of money on Mendoza, but he was defeated. Mendoza met Humphries in the ring on a later occasion and he lost for a second time. It was not until his third match in 1790 that he finally beat Humphries and became Champion of England. Meanwhile, he founded a highly successful Academy and even Lord Byron became one of his pupils. He earned enormous sums of money and was paid as much as $100 for a single appear one of his pupils. He earned enormous sums of money and was paid as much as $100 for a single appearance. Despite this, he was so extravagant that he was always in debt.

One would expect them to know their parts by heart and never have cause to falter. Yet this is not always the case.\nA famous actor in a highly successful play was once cast in the role of an aristocrat who had been imprisoned in the Bastille for twenty years. In the last act, a gaoler would always come on to the stage with a letter which he would hand to the prisoner. Even though the noble was expected to read the letter at each performance, he always insisted that it should be written out in full.\nOne night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart. The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell. Just then, the gaoler appeared with the precious letter in his bands. He entered the cell and presented the letter to the aristocrat. But the copy he gave him had not been written out in full as usual. It was simply a blank sheet of paper. The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines. The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds. Then, squinting his eyes, he said: 'The light is dim. Read the letter to me'. And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler. Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either, the gaoler replied: 'The light is indeed dim, sire, I must get my glasses.' With this, he hurried off the stage. Much to the aristocrat's amusement, the gaoler returned a few moments later with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter with he proceeded to read to the prisoner.\n",

Instead of becoming a doctor, however, he became a successful writer of detective stories. I once spend an uncomfortable weekend which I shall never forget at his house. George showed me to the guestroom which, he said, was rarely used. He told me to unpack my things and then come down to dinner.

Before they were replaced by steamships, sailing vessels like the Cutty Sark were used to carry tea from China and wool from Australia. The Cutty Sark was one the fastest sailing ships that has ever been built. The only other ship to match her was the Thermopylae. Both these ships set out from Shanghai on June 18th, 1872 on an exciting race to England. This race, which went on for exactly four exactly four months, was the last of its kind. It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.\nThe first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae, but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took lead. It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home, but during the race she had a lot of bad luck. In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away. The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her. A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty. This greatly reduced the speed of the ship, for there was a danger that if she traveled too quickly, this rudder would be torn away as well. Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead. After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted, but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead. Though the new rudder was fitted at tremendous speed, it was impossible for the Cutty Sark to win. She arrived in England a week after the Thermopylae. Even this was remarkable, considering that she had had so many delays. These is no doubt that if she had not lost her rudder she would have won the race easily.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 26\nWanted: a large biscuit tin\n\nNo one can avoid being influenced by advertisements. Much as we may pride ourselves on our good taste, we are no longer free to choose the things we want, for advertising exerts a subtle influence on us. In their efforts to persuade us to buy this or that product, advertisers have made a close study of human nature and have classified all our little weaknesses.\nAdvertisers discovered years ago that all of us love to get something for nothing. An advertisement which begins with the magic word FREE can rarely go wrong. These days, advertisers not only offer free samples, but free cars, free houses, and free trips round the world as well. They devise hundreds of competitions which will enable us to win huge sums of money. Radio and television have made it possible for advertisers to capture the attention of millions of people in this way.\nDuring a radio programme, a company of biscuit manufacturers once asked listeners to bake biscuits and send them to their factory. They offered to pay $10 a pound for the biggest biscuit baked by a listener. The response to this competition was tremendous. Before long, biscuits of all shapes and sizes began arriving at the factory. One lady brought in a biscuit on a wheelbarrow. It weighed nearly 500 pounds. A little later, a man came along with a biscuit which occupied the whole boot of his car. All the biscuits that were sent were carefully weighed. The largest was 713 pounds. It seemed certain that this would win the prize. But just before the competition closed, a lorry arrived at the factory with a truly colossal biscuit which weighed 2,400 pounds. It had been baked by a college student who had used over 1,000 pounds of flour, 800 pounds of sugar, 200 pounds of fat, and 400 pounds of various other ingredients. It was so heavy that a crane had to be used to remove it from the lorry. The manufacturers had to pay more money than they had anticipated, or they bought the biscuit from the student for $24,000.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 27\nNothing to sell\n\nWhat is the most important thing for a tramp?\n\nIt has been said that everyone lives by selling something. In the light of this statement, teachers live by selling knowledge, philosophers by selling wisdom and priests by selling spiritual comfort. Though it may be possible to measure the value of material good in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us. There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives, yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service. The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. Everyone has something to sell.\nTramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule. Beggars almost sell themselves as human being to arouse the pity of passers-by. But real tramps are not beggars. They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others. In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity. A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him. He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences. He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but his is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people. His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease. By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do. He may hunt, beg, or stead occasionally to keep himself alive; he may even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom. We often speak of my even, in times of real need, do a little work; but he will never sacrifice his freedom. We often speak of tramps with contempt and put them in the same class as beggars, but how many of us can honestly say that we have not felt a little envious of their simple way of life and their freedom from care?\n",

Before she had anchored, the men from the boats had climbed on board and the decks were son covered with colourful rugs from Persia, silks from India, copper coffee pots, and beautiful handmade silverware. It was difficult not to be tempted. Many of the tourists on board had begun bargaining with the tradesmen, but I decide not to buy anything until I had disembarked.\nI had no sooner got off the ship than I was assailed by a man who wanted to sell me a diamond ring. I had no intention of buying one, but I could not conceal the fact that I was impressed by the size of the diamonds. Some of them were as big as marbles. The man went to great lengths to prove that the diamonds were real. As we were walking past a shop, he held a diamond firmly against the window and made a deep impression in the glass. It took me over half an hour to get rid of him.\nThe next man to approach me was selling expensive pens and watches. I examined one of the pens closely. It certainly looked genuine. At the base of the gold cap, the words 'made in the U.S.A' had been nearly inscribed. The man said that the pen was worth $50, but as a special favour, he would let me have it for $30. I shook my head and held up five fingers indicating that I was willing to pay $5. Gesticulating wildly, the man acted as if he found my offer outrageous, but he eventually reduced the price to $10. Shrugging my shoulders, I began to walk away when, a moment later, he ran after me and thrust the pen into my hands. Though he kept throwing up his arms in despair, he readily accepted the $5 I have him. I felt especially pleased with my wonderful bargain -- until I got back to the ship. No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to fill this beautiful pen with ink and to this day it has never written a single world!\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 29\nFunny or not?\n\nWhether we find a joke funny or not largely depends on were we have been brought up. The sense of humour is mysteriously bound up with national characteristics. A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke. In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke witch would make an Englishman laugh to tears.\nMost funny stories are based on comic situations. In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a universal appeal. No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's early films. However, a new type of humour, which stems largely from the U.S., has recently come into fashion. It is called 'sick humour'. Comedians base their jokes on tragic situation like violent death or serious accidents. Many people find this sort of joke distasteful The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to judge for yourself.\nA man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas. From the moment he arrived there, he kept on pestering his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home. He dreaded having to spend Christmas in hospital. Though the doctors did his best, the patient's recovery was slow. On Christmas Day, the man still had his right leg in plaster. He spent a miserable day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing. The following day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good. The good. The man took heart and, sure enough, on New Years' Eve he was able to hobble along to a party. To compensate for his unpleasant experiences in hospital, the man drank a little more than was good for him. In the process, he enjoyed himself thoroughly and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals. He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 3\nAn unknown goddess\n\nSome time ago, and interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses -- often three storeys high -- were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.\nThe temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. It's missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.\n",

They employed a few farmhands, but no one was willing to work there long. Every time a worker gave up his job, he told the same story. Farm labourers said that they always woke up to find that work had been done overnight. Hay had been cut and cowsheds had been cleaned. A farm worker, who stayed up all night claimed to have seen a figure cutting corn in the moonlight. In time, it became an accepted fact the Cox brothers employed a conscientious ghost that did most of their work for them.\nNo one suspected that there might be someone else on the farm who had never been seen. This was indeed the case. A short time ago, villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of Endley had died. Everyone went to the funeral, for the 'ghost' was none other than Eric Cox, a third brother who was supposed to have died as a young man. After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over fifty years.\nEric had been the eldest son of the family, very much older than his two brothers. He had been obliged to join the army during the Second World War. As he hated army life, he decided to desert his regiment. When he learnt that he would be sent abroad, he returned to the farm and his father hid him until the end of the war. Fearing the authorities, Eric remained in hiding after the war as well. His father told everybody that Eric had been killed in action. The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob. They did not even tell their wives. When their father died, they thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding. All these years, Eric had lived as a recluse. He used to sleep during the day and work at night, quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley. When he died, however, his brothers found it impossible to keep the secret any longer.\n",

They disregard social conventions without being conscious that they are doing anything extraordinary. This invariably wins them the love and respect of others, for they add colour to the dull routine of everyday life.\nUp to the time of his death, Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town. He was a shrewd and wealthy businessman, but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life. He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.\nDickie disliked snobs intensely. Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, preferring always to go on foot. Even when it was raining heavily, he refused to carry an umbrella. One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower. He wanted to buy a $300 watch for his wife, but he was in such a bedraggled condition than an assistant refused to serve him. Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag. As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter. The assistant asked him to leave, but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager. Recognizing who the customer was, the manager was most apologetic and reprimanded the assistant severely. When Dickie was given the watch, the presented the assistant with the cloth bag. It contained $300 in pennies. He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left -- 30,000 pennies in all! On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings. This exhibition received a great deal of attention in the press, for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists, they had in fact been painted by Dickie. It took him four years to stage this elaborate joke simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.\n",

A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain instructing him to give up the search. The captain knew that another attempt would be made later, for the sunken ship he was trying to find had been carrying a precious cargo of gold bullion.\nDespite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more. The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets and there was tremendous excitement on board went a chest was raised from the bottom. Though the crew were at first under the impression that the lost ship had been found, the contents of the chest proved them wrong. What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before.\nThe chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding. There were books, clothing and photographs, together with letters which the seaman had once received from his wife. The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to salvage as much as possible from the wreck. Nothing of value was found, but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest. From a heavy gun that was raised, the captain realized that the ship must have been a cruiser. In another chest, which contained the belongings of a ship's officer, there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943. The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen. The most valuable find of all was the ship's log book, parts of which it was still possible to read. From this the captain was able to piece together all the information that had come to light. The Karen had been sailing in a convoy to Russia when she was torpedoed by an enemy submarine. This was later confirmed by naval official at the Ministry of Defiance after the Elkor had returned home. All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.\n",

What invariably happens is that a great number of things choose to go wrong at precisely the same moment. It is as if a single unimportant event set up a chain of reactions. Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.\nThings can go wrong on a big scale, as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney. During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue. The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car. This made the driver following her brake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake. As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying through the air, a lorry driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and on to the road. This led to yet another angry argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again. In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles. Only two stray dogs benefited from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake. It was just one of those days!\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 34\nA happy discovery\n\nAntique shops exert a peculiar fascination on a great many people. The more expensive kind of antique shop where rare objects are beautifully displayed in glass cases to keep them free from dust is usually a forbidding place. But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop. There is always hope that in its labyrinth of musty, dark, disordered rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of assorted junk that little the floors.\nNo one discovers a rarity by chance. A truly dedicated bargain hunter must have patience, and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it. To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer. Like a scientist bent on making a discovery, he must cherish the hope that one day he will be amply rewarded.\nMy old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person. He has often described to me how he picked up a masterpiece for a mere $50. One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood. As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to interest him. The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor. The morning passed rapidly and Frank just come in, but that he could not be bothered to open it. Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open. The contents were disappointing. Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger, the box was full of crockery, much of it broken. Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box an suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom of the packing case. As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it. Glancing at it briefly, the dealer told him that it was worth $50. Frank could hardly conceal his excitement, for he knew that he had made a real discovery. The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece by Correggio and was worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 35\nJustice was done\n\nThe word justice is usually associated with courts of law. We might say that justice has been done when a man's innocence or guilt has been proved beyond doubt. Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law. Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it. Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.\nThere are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept. Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference. At such times, justice acts like a living force. When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.\nWhen a thief was caught on the premises of large jewellery store on morning, the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right.' The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys. Towards midday, a girl heard a muffed cry coming from behind on of the walls. As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade. The cry had certainly come form one of the chimneys, but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was. They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries. After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney. As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move, but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall. The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney. He had been there for nearly ten hours. Justice had been done even before the man was handed over to the police.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 36\nA chance in a million\n\nWe are less credulous than we used to be. In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences -- most of them wildly improbable. Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maidservant was really the hero's mother. A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time and wickedly plotting to bring about the hero's downfall. And so on. Modern readers would find such naive solution totally unacceptable. Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.\nWhen I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stooped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz poured scorn on the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busssman fully acquainted with this story, she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother. When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. After having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit. The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants. Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid, Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 37\nThe Westhaven Express\n\nWe have learnt to expect that trains will be punctual. After years of conditioning, most of us have developed an unshakable faith in railway timetables. Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather, but trains must be on time. Only an exceptionally heavy snowfall might temporarily dislocate railway services. It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong. The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.\nAfter consulting my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven. It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted mere hour and seventeen minutes. When I boarded the train, I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well. At the time, this did not strike me as odd. I reflected that there must be a great many local people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service. Neither was I surprise when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line. Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals. But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder, It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour, but barely chugging along at thirty. One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance. I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it. I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived. Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven. When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable. There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white. Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again. A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page. It said: 'This service has been suspended.'\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 38\nThe first calender\n\nFuture historians will be in a unique position when they come to record the history of our own times. They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that steadily accumulates. What is more, they will not have to rely solely on the written word. Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMS are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have. They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action. But the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task. He has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues available. Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light on the history of early man.\nUp to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture, for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons. Recent scientific evidence seems to indicate that this assumption is incorrect.\nHistorians have long been puzzled by dots, lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls, bones, and the ivory tusks of mammoths. The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age which began about 35,000 B.C. and ended about 10,000 B.C. By correlating markings made in various parts of the world, historians have been able to read this difficult code. They have found that it is connected with the passage of days and the phases of the moon. It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar. It has long been known that the hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression. They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing. It is possible that there is a definite relation between these paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them. It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed.\n",

Even though the road was littered with boulders and pitted with holes, Bruce was not in the least perturbed. Glancing at his map, he informed us that the next village was a mere twenty miles away. It was not that Bruce always underestimated difficulties. He simply had no sense of danger at all. No matter what the conditions were, he believed that a car should be driven as fast as it could possibly go.\nAs we bumped over eh dusty track, we swerved to avoid large boulders. The wheels scooped up stones which hammered ominously under the car. We felt sure that sooner or later a stone would rip a hole in our petrol tank or damage the engine. Because of this, we kept looking back, wondering if we were leaving a trail of oil and petrol behind us.\nWhat a relief it was when the boulders suddenly disappeared, giving way to a stretch of plain where the only obstacles were clumps of bushes. But there was worse to come. Just ahead of us there was a huge fissure. In response to renewed pleadings, Bruce stopped. Though we all got out to examine the fissure, he remained in the car. We informed him that the fissure extended for fifty years and was tow feet wide and four feet deep. Even this had no effect. Bruce went into a low gear and drove at a terrifying speed, keeping the front wheels astride the crack as he followed its zigzag course. Before we had time to worry about what might happen, we were back on the plain again. Bruce consulted the map once more and told us that the village was now only fifteen miles away. Our next obstacle was a shallow pool of water about half a mile across. Bruce charged at it, but in the middle, the car came to a grinding half. A yellow light on the dashboard flashed angrily and Bruce cheerfully announced that there was no oil in the engine!\n",

People who work in offices are frequently referred to as \"white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work. Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.\nWhen he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation. Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman. Before returning home at night. He took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office. He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr. Bloggs', not 'Alf'.\n",

Students specialize in a particular type of practical joke: the hoax. Inviting the fire brigade to put out a nonexistent fire is a crude form of deception which no self-respecting student would ever indulge in. Students often create amusing situations which are funny to everyone except the victims.\nWhen a student recently saw two workmen using a pneumatic drill outside his university, he immediately telephoned the police and informed them that two students dressed up as workmen were tearing up the road with a pneumatic drill. As soon as he had hung up, he went over to the workmen and told them that if a policeman ordered them to go away, they were not take him seriously. He added that a student had dressed up as a policeman and was playing all sorts of silly jokes on people. Both the police and the workmen were grateful to the student for this piece of advance information.\nThe student did in an archway nearby where he could watch and hear everything that went on. Sure enough, a policeman arrived on the scene and politely asked the workmen to go away. When he received a very rude reply from one of the workmen. He threatened to remove them by force. The workmen told him to do as he pleased and the policeman telephoned for help. Shortly afterwards, four more policemen arrived and remonstrated with the workmen. As the men refused to stop working, the police attempted to seize the pneumatic drill. The workmen struggled fiercely and one of them lost his temper. He threatened to call the police. At this, the police pointed out ironically that this would hardly be necessary as the men were already under arrest. Pretending to speak seriously, one of the workmen asked if he might make a telephone call before being taken to the station. Permission was granted and a policeman accompanied him to a pay phone. Only when he saw that the man was actually telephoning the police did he realize that they had all been the victims of a hoax.\n",

I have always regarded the country as something you look at through a train window, or something you occasional visit during the weekend. Most of my friends live in the city, yet they always go into raptures at the mere mention of the country. Though they extol the virtues of the peaceful life, only one of hem has ever gone to live in the country and he was back in town within six months. Even he still lives under the illusion that country life is somehow superior to town life. He is forever talking about the friendly people, the clean atmosphere, the closeness to nature and the gentle pace of living. Nothing can be compared, he maintains, with the first cockcrow, the twittering of birds at dawn, the sight of the rising sun glinting on the trees and pastures. This idyllic pastoral scene is only part of the picture. My friend fails to mention the long and friendless winter evenings in front of the TV -- virtually the only form of entertainment. He says nothing about the poor selection of goods in the shops, or about those unfortunate people who have to travel from the country to the city every day to get to work. Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.\nIf you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They invariably lie nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment. Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning. As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home. The cit dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry. Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me who city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 42\nModern cavemen\n\nCave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber. They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.\nExploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations. It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave. Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer. The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet. This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks. The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps. As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable. The cave might never have been discovered has not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger. Since its discovery, it has become a sort of potholers' Everest. Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.\nA team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger. After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to narrow corridor. They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools. Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits. At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water. In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites -- some of them over forty feet high -- rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow. In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.\n",

If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather. Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay. It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for cost of salvaging a sunken ship. But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.\nAdmittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip. Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own. Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.\nThe pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish. Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish. They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem. The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it. Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation. The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water. The men were now obliged to try once more. This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains. The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal. The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. Several minutes later, the dish was again put into operation and one of the water. Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. There was danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.\n",

Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours. Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy. It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey. Reading is only a partial solution, for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep. During the day, sleep comes in snatches. At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper, you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling, or fumbling to find you ticket for inspection. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic. By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food -- always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm. If it is not, and you are likely to get seasick, no form of transport could be worse. Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of travlling by sea.\nAeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated by them. They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport. But nothing can match them for speed and comfort. Travelling at a height of 30,000 feet, far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience. You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly. For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight. The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available, there is plenty to keep you occupied. An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world. You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. You really see the shape of the land. If the landscape is hidden from view, you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles before you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky. The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled. You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey.\n",

Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political events. Though we may enjoy reading about the lives of others, it is extremely doubtful whether we would equally enjoy reading about ourselves. Acting on the contention that facts are sacred, reporters can cause untold suffering to individuals by publishing details about their private lives. Newspapers exert such tremendous influence that they can not only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people but can even overthrow a government.\nThe story of a poor family that acquired fame and fortune overnight, dramatically illustrates the power of the press. The family lived in Aberdeen, a small town of 23,000 inhabitants in South Dakota. As the parents had five children, life was a perpetual struggle against poverty. They were expecting their sixth child and were faced with even more pressing economic problems. If they had only had one more child, the fact would have passed unnoticed. They would have continued to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity. But they suddenly became the parents of quintuplets, an aeroplane arrived in Aberdeen bringing sixty reporters and photographers.\nThe rise to fame was swift. Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the country. Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to publish stories and photographs. Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but room baby food and soap manufacturers who wished to advertise their products. The old farmhouse the family lived in was to be replaced by new $500,000 home. Reporters kept pressing for interviews so lawyers had to be employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press conferences. While the five babies were babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in hospital nursery, their parents were paying the price for fame. It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. They had become the victims of commercialization, for their names had acquired a market value. Instead of being five new family members, these children had immediately become a commodity.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 46\nDo it yourself\n\nSo great is our passion for doing things for ourselves, that we are becoming increasingly less dependent on specialized labour. No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for these are countless do-it-yourself publications. Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes. Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying out their own gardens; building garages and making furniture. Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers. Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.\nSome wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything. Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics. When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some woman assume that their husbands will somehow put things right. The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. It is a question of pride as much as anything else.\nLast spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawn mower. It had broken down the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it. I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself. One Saturday afternoon, I hauled the machine into the garden and had a close look at it. As far as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as good as new. Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple. The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it. The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once made up a lawn mower. But I was extremely pleased with myself. I had traced the cause of the trouble. One of links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped. After buying a new chain I was faced with the insurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together again. I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had reassembled it, for the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not seem to fit anywhere. I gave up in despair. The weeks passed and the grass grew. When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow. Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle. Buried somewhere in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 47\nOur neighbour, the river\n\nThe river which forms the eastern boundary of our farm has always played an important part in our lives. Without it we could not make a living. There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the houses, so we have to pump from the river for farm use. We tell river all our secrets. We know instinctively, just as beekeepers with their bees, that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it.\nWe have special river birthday parties in the summer. Sometimes were go upstream to a favourite backwater, sometimes we have our party at the boathouse, which a predecessor of ours at the farm built in the meadow hard by the deepest pool for swimming and diving. In a heat wave we choose a midnight birthday party and that is the most exciting of all. We welcome the seasons by the riverside, crowning the youngest girl with flowers in the spring, holding a summer festival on Midsummer Eve, giving thanks for the harvest in the autumn, and throwing a holy wreath into the current in the winter.\nAfter a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks. This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom guest to extremes. We are lucky in that only the lower fields, which make up a very small proportion of our farm, are effected by flooding, but other farms are less favorably sited, and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners.\nOne had winter we watched the river creep up the lower meadows. All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little. We were, however, worried about our nearest neighbors, whose farm was low lying and who were newcomers to the district. As the floods had put the telephone out of order, we could not find out how they were managing. From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours, and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point. The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down. Next came a horse, swimming bravely, but we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted. Suddenly a raft appeared, looking rather like Noah's ark, carrying the whole family, a few hens, the dogs, cat, and bird in a cage. We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood, for their house, which had sound foundations, would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged. The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadows with boathooks, in the hope of being able to grapple a corner of the raft and pull it out of the current towards our bank. We still think it a miracle that they we able to do so.\n",

We always assume that villagers in remote places are friendly and hospitable. But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers. Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.\nWe had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity. These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town. This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside. Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees. We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. In it there was a boatman fast asleep. We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side. Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.\nThe path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby. Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. When we later walked down the main street of the villager, we were followed by a silent procession of children. The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. Faces appeared at windows. Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways. The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard. There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. We needed no further warning. Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.\n",

Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic. When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refuse to publish it. The article began: 'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace'. The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.\nThe journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but the took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press. He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply. He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired. When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written. A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist. Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well. However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.\n",

The same old favorites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't' like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercise every morning and to read more of an evening. An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.\nThe daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable. Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out. After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. It was this that betrayed me. The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. However, my enthusiasm waned. The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished. Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home formwork Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to book. One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading. In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!\n",

Who could have imagined, in the mid 1970s, for example, that by the end of the 20th century, computers would be as common in people's homes as TV sets? In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government departments, and large organizations. These were the so-called mainframe machines. Mainframe computers were very large indeed, often occupying whole air-conditioned rooms, employing full-time technicians and run on specially-written software. Though these large machines still exist, many of their functions have been taken over by small powerful personal computers, commonly known as PCs.\nIn 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA. It can properly be described as the first 'home computer' and it pointed the way to the future. This was followed, at the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple. In the early 1980s, the computer giant, IBM produced the world's first Personal Computer. This ran on an 'operating system' called DOS, produced by a then small company named Microsoft. The IBM Personal Computer was widely copied. From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user-friendly home computers and multimedia machines which are in common use today.\nConsidering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today. Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days. Bagrit foresaw a time when computers would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work. All these computer uses have become commonplace. Of course, Leon Bagrit could not possibly have foreseen the development of the Internet, the worldwide system that enables us to communicate instantly with anyone in any part of the world by using computers linked to telephone networks. Nor could he have foreseen how we could use the Internet to obtain information on every known subject, so we can read it on a screen in our homes and even print it as well if we want to. Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper. This is what makes Leon Bagrit's predictions particularly remarkable. If he, or someone like him, were alive today, he might be able to tell us what to expect in the next fifty years.\n",

Despite the fact that the bottle is tinted a delicate shade of green, an observant visitor would soon notice that it is filled with what looks like a thick, grayish substance. If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud. If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin. This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have. The bottle really does contain perfumed mud. How Harry came into the possession of this outlandish stuff makes an interesting story which he is fond of relating. Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years.\nHarry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist. He would invent fanciful names on the spot. On entering a shop, he would ask for a new perfume called 'Scented Shadow' or for 'insoluble bath cubes'. If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out. He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did. How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me.\nHarry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud. One day, he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for 'Myrolite', the shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable. When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite' was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles. This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf. She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements. When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him. Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud. He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment. However, it was his turn to be surprised, for the woman's eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect. For once, Harry had to admit defeat. He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price. He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm. From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive. The curious bottle, which now adorns the bookcase in his study, was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.\n",

Sweden has evolved an excellent system for protecting the individual citizen from highhanded or incompetent public officers. The system has worked so well, that it has been adopted in other countries too.\nThe Swedes were the first to recognize that public official like civil servants, police officers, health inspectors or tax-collectors can make mistakes or act over-zealously in the belief that they are serving the public. As long ago as 1809, the Swedish Parliament introduced a scheme to safeguard the interest of the individual. A parliamentary committee representing all political parties appoints a person who is suitably qualified to investigate private grievances against the State. The official title of the person is 'Justiteombudsman', but the Swedes commonly refer to him as the 'J.O.' or 'Ombudsman'. The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure. He investigates complaints large and small that come to him from all levels of society. As complaints must be made in writing, the Ombudsman receives an average of 1,200 letters a year. He has eight lawyer assistants to help him and examines every single letter in detail. There is nothing secretive about the Ombudsman's work for his correspondence is open to public inspection. If a citizen's complaint is justified, the Ombudsman will act on his behalf. The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint. He may gently reprimand an official or even suggest to parliament that a law the altered. The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman's work.\nA foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been ill-treated by the police, simply because he was a foreigner. The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case. There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner's complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation. It was impossible for the Ombudsman to take action, but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village, he immediately sent one of his layers to investigate the matter. The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt roughly with foreigners on several occasions. The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be recorded in the official files. It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts. The policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if any further complaints were lodged against him, he would prosecuted. The Ombudsman's prompt action at once put an end to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed.\n",

We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat ageist our lighted windows. We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless one like moths. Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. No matter how much we like honey, or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence. Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle?\nLast summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree. The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. I am especially proud of it, not only because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. During the summer, I noticed tat the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. Clusters of tin insects called aphids were to be found on the underside of the leaves. They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them. I immediately embarked on an experiment which, even though if failed to get rid of the ants, kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours. I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids. The tape was so stick that they did not dare to cross it. For a long time. I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it. I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route. They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree. I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 55\nFrom the earth: Greetings\n\nRecent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our won Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and old not emit light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our won solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.\nWhether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. Imagine a star up t twenty times larger, brighter, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we find such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century.\nIt is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles iron solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'. The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope is always in the realms of science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it.\"\n",

I was only five when my father had taken me abroad, and that we eighteen years ago. When my mother had died after a tragic accident, he did not quickly recover from the shock and loneliness. Everything around him was full of her presence, continually reopening the wound. So he decided to emigrate. In the new country he became absorbed in making a new life for the two of us, so that he gradually ceased to grieve. He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman's care; but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me. He always meant to go back on day, but not to stay. His roots and mine bad become too firmly embedded in the new land. But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother's grave. He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and, when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own.\nI hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps, which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage. It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone, after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory. Well, I had been wrong, for I was now lost.\nI looked at the map and then at the millimeter. I had come ten miles since leaving the town, and at this point, according to my father, I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance. I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages and no church spire -- only a lake. I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere. So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map. I landed up at the same corner. The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map. I left as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams. And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me. Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback, riding in my direction. I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village. He said that there was now no village. I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name. This time he pointed to the lake. The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too. The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 58\nA spot of bother\n\nThe old lady was glad to be back at the block of flats where she lived. Her shopping had tired her and her basket ad grown heavier with every step of the way home. In the life her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest; but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks, She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence. Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the porter from his basement. By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police. Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for nay intruders who might still be lurking in her flat.\nThey went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints. The chaos was inconceivable. She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding; and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over. At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her. Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat. The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony. There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers. So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars' first job that day and they must have been disturbed. The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights. The old lady though the was a fussy creature, but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 59\nCollecting\n\nPeople tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.\nSome things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste. Among these I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites. Collecting small items can easily become a mania. I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money. As she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote; but she is never sufficiently strong-minded to be able to stop the practice. It is a harmless bait, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction.\nCollecting as a serous hobby is quite different and has many advantages. It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy. One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home. Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books. This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it. There are also other benefits. One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find. So one's circle of friends grows. Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country. Over the years, one may well become a authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences. In this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to take about it. Collecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.\n",

Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.\nThe silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its home blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stocking over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.\n",

Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did note in your back pocket? When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't despair when they made mistakes like this (and a lot of people do)! Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money!\nA recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fianc��, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had very good day and put his wallet containing $3,000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping. Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fianc��'s wallet as well. Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilate Ladies! They examined the remain and John got all his money back. 'So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back,' said a spokeswoman for the Bank. 'Last year, we paid $1.5m on 21,000 claims. Damaged bank notes. The Queen's head appears on English bank notes, and 'lady' refers to this.\n",

The famous monastery of St. Bernard, witch was founded in eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. Now that a tunnel ahs been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.\nDuring the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to -- 30 o and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer of they have more privacy. The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure. The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Bernard's monastery.\n",

      "text": "## Lesson 9\nFlying cats\n\nCats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence. Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.\nRecently the New York Animal Medical Center made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings. There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth. 'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers.' a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.\n",

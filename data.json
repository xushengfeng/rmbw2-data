"title":"15.2 Voyager Station: The First Space Hotel Set to Open in 2027",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"Human beings' curiosity about outer space hasn't declined in the past decade，and with Jeff Bezos' historic commercial flight to the edge of space this past summer，dreamers are that much closer to experiencing the Galaxy for themselves.\n\nIt's reported that one company is aiming to make space a reality for people，and is pioneering a new age of space tourism. In 2019，the California­based company Gateway Foundation first explored the idea. Its dream was to make visiting space，in excellent accommodation，a future vacation choice. The project，now called Voyager Station，is run by Orbital Assembly Corporation，a construction company led by head of the Gateway Foundation and former pilot，John Blincow.\n\nSpace tourism draws closer as Orbital Assembly Corporation has announced plans to build the world's first space hotel named “Voyager Station”，which is expected to open in 2027. With a date in close sight，the hotel's architects and engineers are hard at work，aiming to design an out­of­this­world experience. They plan to decorate the suites with elegant bars and restaurants with a touch of space，as well as Earth­viewing lounges and unique space food treats. The team is also taking advantage of the reduced gravity that will be felt in the station to plan to let their guests weightlessly carry heavy objects，jump higher or run faster in ways people can't normally do on Earth.\n\nGravity will remain in the rooms and bars though because Voyager Station's scientific design makes it possible by creating artificial gravity within the hotel. The hotel is designed as a wheel that will steadily move and create simulated gravitational force，much like when a glass of water is spun around，the water doesn't pour out. The hotel's guests won't feel much different than being on a huge ship steadily moving.\n\n\n\n5．What do we know about the Gateway Foundation?\n\n_A．It aimed to build a space hotel.\n\nB．It made space a reality for people.\n\nC．It promoted space tourism greatly.\n\nD．It planned a historic commercial flight.\n\n\n\n6．What will the Voyager Station team use the reduced gravity to do?\n\nA．Provide unique space food.\n\nB．Let guests do space sports.\n\n_C．Offer recreational activities.\n\nD．Decorate suites more easily.\n\n\n\n7．Why does gravity exist in the rooms and bars?\n\nA．To prevent liquid from pouring.\n\n_B．To make guests feel comfortable.\n\nC．To avoid guests' travel sickness.\n\nD．To keep things in normal positions.\n\n\n\n8．What's the text mainly about?\n\nA．Time for Space Travel.\n\nB．Space tourism gaining popularity.\n\nC．First­ever commercial flight to space.\n\n_D．First space hotel set to open in 2027.",

"text":"The number of weather­related disasters has increased by five times over the past 50 years，the latest report by the World Meteorological (气象) Organization(WMO)said on September 1. However，thanks to improved early warning systems and disaster management，the number of death from these hazards (危险) has been almost three times less.\n\nAccording to the WMO，from 1970 to 2019，weather，climate and water hazards accounted for 50 percent of all disasters. Among the top 10 hazards that led to the largest loss of human life during this period were droughts，storms，floods and extreme temperatures. However，deaths fell from over 50,000 in the 1970s to less than 20,000 in the 2010s.\n\n“Weather，climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change，” says WMO Secretary­General Petteri Taalas.\n\n“That means more heatwaves，drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapor in the atmosphere，which is worsening extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms.”\n\n“Economic losses are increasing as exposure increases. But behind the statistics lies a message of hope. Improved multi­hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in deaths. Quite simply，we are better than ever before at saving lives，” Taalas said.\n\n\n2．What will happen according to Petteri Taalas?\n\n_A．There will be more extreme weather.\n\nB．Extreme rainfall will no longer exist.\n\nC．Water vapor in the atmosphere will go down.\n\nD．Human will conquer extreme weather in the end.\n\n",

"text":"The curtains came down on the closing ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games Sunday night at Bird's Nest in Beijing. During the ceremony，many Chinese cultural elements were put into the design of the grand show，expressing some Chinese romance. They became the highlights of the closing ceremony and let's take a look.\n\n## Festive lanterns\n\nThe closing ceremony began with a large snowflake torch appearing in the sky，echoing the moment from the opening ceremony. Then accompanied by cheerful music，children hung traditional Chinese festive lanterns，lighting up the emblem (徽章) of the Winter Olympics，which originated from the Chinese character for winter，“dong”．\n\n## The Chinese knot\n\nThe 12 Chinese zodiac (生肖)­themed ice cars created an outline of a Chinese knot with their wheel trails. And then it was enlarged，and an enormous “Chinese knot” was presented using digital AR technology. Each ribbon could be clearly seen，and all of the ribbons twisted together，symbolizing unity and a good fortune.\n\n## Fish and riches\n\nDuring the closing ceremony，the Malanhua Children's Choir from a mountainous area of Fuping county in Hebei Province performed again，this time with different clothes. The Chinese paper­cut of double fish was seen on their clothes，meaning “rich and have a surplus in the next year” in Chinese culture.\n\n## Willow (柳树) branches for farewell\n\nIn ancient times，Chinese people broke a willow branch and gave it to their friends，family or relatives when seeing them off，as willow sounds like “stay” in Mandarin. Willow branches appeared in the closing ceremony，expressing Chinese people's hospitality and bidding farewell to the world guests.\n\n1．Which of the following is inspired by a Chinese character?\n\nA．Festive lanterns.\n\nB．A snowflake torch.\n\n_C．The emblem.\n\nD．Cheerful music.\n\n\n2．What characteristic did “The Chinese knot” and “Fish and riches” share?\n\nA．Both employed AR technology.\n\n_B．Both symbolized a wealthy life.\n\nC．Both were created by ice cars.\n\nD．Both were performed by children.\n\n\n3．Which one can be adopted as a symbol of departure?\n\nA．Festive lanterns.\n\nB．The Chinese knot.\n\nC．Fish and riches.\n\n_D．Willow branches\n",

"text":"In a bid to hold a simple，safe and yet splendid Winter Games，the opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games was not lengthy or marked with a large­scale performance. The Olympic cauldron (主火炬) at the snowflake­themed ceremony was small，but the flames conveyed significant messages of greener Olympic Games.\n\nThe use of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence，machine vision,5G and cloud broadcasting added to the novelty of the opening ceremony. The performances，which carried forward the theme of global peace and shared future for humankind，focused on environmental protection，and human health and physical fitness.\n\nTo reduce the carbon footprint of the Winter Games，all the Olympic venues were run on clean energy. For example，about 70 percent of the materials used in the Games were obtained through renting，including new sporting equipment，furniture in the Olympic village，and technical devices. Also，the medal platforms were made of recyclable and environmentally friendly materials.\n\nMore importantly，thrift，a traditional Chinese virtue，can help build a healthy social environment for China to realize its targets of peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. All this made the 2022 Winter Games an important Olympics to focus on achieving carbon neutrality.\n\n",

"text":"We moved into a new neighborhood in 1990. Andy was pretty much the first person we met. He came across the street to greet us. Having lived there since 1967, he was warm and kind, full of energy. He would introduce to us which bakery for cakes, which store for shopping and even the occupations of everyone around us.\n\nAndy would proudly and regularly wear his veteran(老兵) cap and play music while doing yard work. More than anything, though, he delighted in talking about our kids as much as about his. We watched out for each other. He would keep an eye on our vegetable gardens when we went on vacation; we gave him some of our produce in return. Andy and I would also complain about the big trucks that used our streets as a shortcut. As more time went by, we didn't see him out walking his small dog as often due to his health problem, and we'd help with clearing the snow in the winter. Those ties continued with time passing by.\n\nBut the real tie of our neighborhoods is their people—an Andy，or，in some cases，many Andys. Our neighborhoods are built on them，and strengthened by their emotional ties. We are better for their presence，and worse for their absence.\n\nAndy died this month. I will miss him, more than he imagines.\n\n",

"lastPosi":0.48222994389018947,
"text":"Tobogganing, or sledding (乘雪橇), likely comes before the colonization of North America. Records show that Canada's First Peoples used small sleds to transport their belongings and food between camps, Raymond Flower writes in The History of Skiing and Other Winter Sports. But modern­day sled races can trace their origins back to the Swiss Alps in the late 1800s when British tourists decided to race in wooden luges (a sled used by one person) that locals had used to travel through snow. The origin is debatable in snowy northern New York, however, where there's evidence that Albany held bobsled (a sled used by two or more people) races as early as 1885.\n\nWherever they began, sled races quickly became popular. The famous Cresta Run, named after the Swiss town near the base of its course, was built in 1885 using snowbanks. The first organized competition was in 1898, hosted by the first bobsled club in nearby St. Moritz (a city in Switzerland)．It was then that sledding began to separate from the luge to include two new sports: bob sledding, and skeleton sledding (俯式雪橇)．\n\nCresta Run is considered the birthplace of the skeleton, a particularly daring form of sledding. Unlike the luge, where competitors ride feet­first on a sled with metal runners, the skeleton sledding is a steel sled with a slim appearance. Riders lie down on the sled head­first, then drop suddenly down an ice track. Bobsledding, meanwhile, involves teams of two to four in which the person in front controls directions and the player in back brakes when needed. It earned its name after competitors started swinging back and forth to speed up the sled.\n\nBobsledding initially overtook skeleton sledding in popularity, becoming one of a handful of sports played at the first Winter Games in 1924. The skeleton sledding was limited to the Cresta Run for decades because other bob runs around the world were not built for the steel skeleton sled. But in the 1970s, adjustments were made to both the skeleton and bob runs in order to include the event at future winter games.\n",

Especially for children，museums introduce them to unknown worlds，inspire their imagination and provide them with valuable learning experiences. It's generally believed that museums only help fuel academic education. But in fact，they provide knowledge regarding all walks of life.\n\nMuseums offer children bigger connections and references to history than a traditional class. They play a huge role in impacting their historical knowledge and the innovation taking place before their eyes. Parents themselves don't have to be history lovers. Just reading out to them，encouraging them to ask questions and holding their attention.\n\nMuseums are a collection of resources that promote informal education. Individuals acquire values，knowledge，and skills that are not applicable to the only field but will aid them for a lifetime. A single visit to a museum near you will provide children with in­depth knowledge about different subjects that they can acquire slowly，for museums let you stay as long as you want.\n\nMuseums are well enough equipped to awaken curiosity in young minds，which in turn will lead to these children asking questions. Some of these questions may have immediate answers. Some of them might need a great deal of thought to answer and some of them might not have any answers at all. No matter what they asked，all of these questions must be equally encouraged and children must be given the confidence to find the answers to them on their own.\n\nMuseums have the ability to leave its visitors in awe of the huge amount of information it holds. They provide inspiration to young children via its resources that leave them fascinated about the night sky and the solar system，the skeletons that keep them thinking about life before them，the artworks that arouse the creative mind，etc. All in all，museums encourage children to dream and wonder.\n",

"text":"A walk in the park may be just what the doctor ordered. A new program launched last month in Canada gives some doctors the option of providing patients with a free annual pass to the country's national parks as part of an effort to increase access to nature and the health benefits.\n\nPaRx, a health initiative launched by the BC Parks Foundation in 2019, partnered with Parks Canada to provide doctors across four provinces with an initial run of 100 passes that can be prescribed (开处方)．The program allows doctors to write more general prescriptions for time spent out in nature; two hours a week, at least 20 minutes at a time, is what PaRx director Dr. Melissa Lem suggests.\n\n“Given the growing body of evidence that indicates nature time can improve all kinds of different physical and mental health conditions, we're hoping that our PaRx program not only improves patient health, but reduces costs to the health­care system, and helps to grow the number of people who are more engaged environmental advocates,” said Prama Rahman, a coordinator for the BC Parks Foundation.\n\nDoctors have been catching on, instructing their patients to turn to nature to improve their health and they're getting creative in how they do it. Dr. Robert Zarr, a doctor based in Washington, began prescribing accessible outdoor activities for his young patients and even created a searchable online database of local parks to make it easier.\n\nBut getting outside isn't always as easy as it might sound. Income can affect one's access to nature, an issue that PaRx is trying to address in Canada. Doctors  utilizing  the new national parks pass program are urged to prioritize patients who might not otherwise be able to afford these passes.\n\nWhile only 100 adult passes, which give holders access to more than 80 national parks, historic sites and nature reserves, have initially been made available, organizers plan to routinely reassess this number as the program grows, the BC Parks Foundation told NPR.\n\n\n5．What is PaRx intended to do?\n\nA．Qualify doctors to prescribe.\n\n_B．Give patients free access to parks.\n\nC．Promote free admission to parks.\n\nD．Advocate 20 minutes' walk a day.\n\n\n\n7．What can we infer from the last paragraph?\n\nA．The BC Parks Foundation is expanding rapidly.\n\nB．The program has signed up 80 national parks.\n\n_C．More people will benefit from the program.\n\nD．Those living close to parks can gain priority.\n\n\n\n",

"text":"A letter written to a 12­year­old girl in Lithuania was delivered in December，almost 51 years after it was sent by a pen pal in Poland.“I thought that someone was pranking me，” said Genovefa Klonovska after being handed the letter，which included a handmade colored rose and two paper dolls.\n\nThe letter，together with 17 others，fell out of a ventilation hole (通风口) this summer，dirty and wrinkled，as a wall was taken down in a former post office on the suburb of Vilnius. Jurgis Vilnius，owner of the building immediately called the post office.“I'm so happy they got interested，” said he.\n\nStreet names and their numbering have changed in Vilnius，and post office workers spent months looking for the right houses and talking to current renters and neighbors，tracking down where the recipients moved to. Only five were found. In several cases children of late recipients were handed a lost letter.\n\n“We felt a moral duty to do this，” said Deimante Zebrauskaite，head of the customer experience department at Lithuania Post.\n\nOne lady compared the experience to receiving a message from a bottle thrown into the sea. People were emotional.“Some felt they saw a part of daily life of their deceased parents，” Zebrauskaite said.\n\nIn the letter to Klonovska，sent from Koezary in Poland and stamped in 1970，a girl named Ewa complains buses no longer reach her village，so she has to walk in minus 23 degree Celsius cold，and asks for pictures of actors.\n\nNow in her 60s，Klonovska has no memory of Ewa. She probably wrote Ewa after finding her address advertising for pen pals in a newspaper，and the relationship ceased after the letter got undelivered.\n\n“So good that the letter didn't matter much. The loss was not life­changing，” said Klonovska. “What if they delivered a lost letter from a suitor (求婚者) to his love，and their wedding never happened？”\n\n1．What does the underlined word “pranking” in paragraph 1 mean?\n\nA．Brightening.　　　　　\tB．Embarrassing.\n\n_C．Tricking. \tD．Pleasing.\n\n\n2．What happened to the letters in paragraph 2?\n\n_A．They were accidentally found.\n\nB．They remained well­preserved.\n\nC．They were delivered by the former post office.\n\nD．They were hidden by the owner of the building.\n\n\n3．Which of the following best describes the present post office in Vilnius?\n\nA．Generous. \t_B．Dutiful.\n\nC．Honest. \tD．Cautious.\n\n4．What can we learn from what Klonovska said?\n\nA．Klonovska refused a suitor.\n\nB．Klonovska stopped the wedding.\n\nC．The undelivered letter ruined the relationship.\n\n_D．The undelivered letter made little difference to her.\n",

"text":"When Ken was in high school，he did well and had a strong sense of accomplishment. However，when he is in college，his grades are not so outstanding among academically gifted students much like himself，if not better. Often he feels depressed and is withdrawing from people and activities. Unfortunately，he is no exception. The literature generally has found that many of us tend to let our self­worth be contingent (依情况而定的)upon external events(such as academics and physical attractiveness)．When our self­worth depends on those，it's unstable. As a result，our feelings about ourselves can end up being in the hands of others.\n\nObviously，we all want to experience things that make us feel good. But when we have contingent self­worth，we might engage in activities that make us feel worthy while avoiding activities that make us feel unworthy. That may pose potential dangers. Instead of working hard to meet our goals，we'll try to avoid failure. And if we do fail one day，we might abandon our goals，lose motivation，or make excuses to help ourselves feel better.\n\nLet's cite some examples to further demonstrate that. If our self­worth is contingent upon being successful at work，we might only choose jobs that are easy. That way we never fail and ensure that we always know that we are worthy. Or，maybe we only think we're worthy if we weigh less than 50 kg. We might undereat or engage in unhealthy eating practices just to make sure that we feel good.\n\nSelf­worth is an important psychological construct that affects not only how we think about ourselves but it also has an impact on our psychological health and functioning. So，give up the idea of seeking approval from others. Instead，learn to base your self­worth on internal contingencies like virtues and faiths. Doing so reminds us to be fully aware of who we are.\n",

"text":"\nOn a break from his studies in the MIT Media Lab, Anirudh Sharma traveled home to Mumbai, India. While there, he noticed that throughout the day his T­shirts were gradually gathering something that looked like dirt. “I realized this was air pollution, or sooty (烟尘覆盖的) particulate matter (PM), made of black particles released from exhaust (尾气) of vehicles，” Sharma says.“This is a major health issue.” Soot consists of tiny black particles, about 2.5 micrometers or smaller, made of carbon produced by incomplete burning of fossil fuels.\n\nBack at MIT, Sharma set out to help solve this air­pollution issue. After years of research and development, Sharma's start­up Graviky Labs has developed technology that attaches to exhaust systems of diesel generators to collect particulate matter. Scientists at Graviky then turn it into ink, called Air­Ink, for artists around the world. So far, the start­up has collected 1.6 billion micrograms of particulate matter. More than 200 gallons of Air­Ink have been harvested for a growing community of more than 1,000 artists, from Bangalore to Boston, Shanghai，and London.\n\nPosted all over Graviky Labs' social media platform page today are photos of art made from Air­Ink and paints, including street wall paintings, body art and clothing prints. At first, there was still no specific application for the ink. Then the start­up decided to find new ways to further spread its mission. It chose to do so through art. “Art helps us raise awareness about where the ink and paints come from. Air pollution knows no borders. Our ink sends a message that pollution is the one of the resources in our world that's the hardest to collect and use. But it can be done，” Sharma says.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

"text":" Life can take any turn at any time or movement. It is unpredictable. One truth about life is that we can't spend it alone to live the journey.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, my left leg was injured. The doctor declared it a serious injury, and I would be in bed for three months. As a full­time social worker, I hardly had time to visit my home. However, my broken leg stopped all my work, which was bad and also good, giving me an opportunity to spend time with myself and my family.\n\nI was upset. How would I spend three months in bed at home? Early in my injury and before my operation, there were so many ups and downs in my confidence. So many times, negative thoughts bothered me.\n\nI felt very depressed but each time I got support from my family and friends. I decided to change my lifestyle according to the situation. It was not so simple or easy. I began to practice thinking deeply in silence, read books, and talk with friends. I even planted various plants to help me heal. It was relaxing to water them.\n\nEventually, I am fully recovered, feeling relaxed. At the time of struggle and tough situations, we feel the need of someone who can spend time with us. Their kind presence gives us so much strength and support. They just meet in our heart and family, and just need our love and friendship.\n",

"text":"\nBy morning, Arthur knew what he had to do after sitting all night thinking. He went out and glanced again at his motorcycle. There was no hiding the broken front lamp and the dent(凹痕) on the side. Arthur let out a sigh and went to run errands (跑腿) for his mother first.\n\nIt was late morning before Arthur was free to carry out his plan. He went toward Jay Pritchett's house. When the door opened, Arthur cleared his throat and said，“I'm so sorry. I carelessly knocked into your parked car.” Jay looked at the 17­year­old youth, surprised. Arthur continued, “Sorry for not telling you timely. I was too frightened.”\n\nJay was silent for a minute before saying in a kind voice, “You think it is the right thing to cover up for your brother？” Arthur went pale, wide­eyed. Jay explained that his brother had admitted how he had ridden Arthur's motorcycle and lost control， resulting in the accident. Arthur asked anxiously， “Will he be arrested？” “No, just a small dent.” Seeing Arthur's relieved expression, he went on, “I hope，however， your brother will learn from this. As for you, remember that it is unwise to hide the truth.”\n\nArthur thanked him and set off home. He was proud of his brother's courage in admitting everything. He knew he could look forward to a good night's rest.\n",

"title":"16.2 The Impact of College Education on Social Connections and Loneliness",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"There is a time when many Americans question whether a college degree is worth its cost. However，a recent study found Americans who completed college or university are more likely to have friends and are less lonely than those who only finished high school.\n\nDaniel Cox，director of the Survey Center on American Life，said that in general Americans are experiencing a “friend recession”，meaning a decline in their number of friends. Cox noted “Americans have fewer close friends today than we did in the early 1990s. But men and those without a college degree are particularly affected because they seem to have experienced a much more dramatic decline over that period”．\n\nThe Center questioned 5,054 people this past summer. It found Americans with a college degree feel more socially connected and are more active in their communities than people who didn't go to college. As a result，those who completed college report feeling less lonely.\n\nPrevious research showed that Americans who didn't go to college are less likely to marry. A study found that college­educated women are much more likely to get married than women who dropped out of high school. Another study of people born between 1957 and 1964 found that both men and women who didn't finish high school are less likely to marry than those with more education.\n\nToday,65 percent of college­educated Americans over age 25 are married. About 50 percent of people with a high school diploma, or who dropped out of high school，are married. Those numbers were different in 1990, when marriage rates among the college graduates were at 69 percent，compared with 63 percent for those who did not go to college, says a Pew research report.\n\nThe American Community Life Survey found around 1 in 10 college graduates say they have no close social connections. That number rises among Americans without a degree，where almost 1 in 4 say they have no close friends.\n\n\n",

"title":"14.1 Discovering Sydney",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"Sometime in the early 1960s，a significant thing happened in Sydney，Australia. The city discovered its harbor. Then，one after another，Sydney discovered lots of things that were just sort of there—broad parks，superb beaches，and a culturally diverse population. But it is the harbor that makes the city.\n\nAndrew Reynolds，a cheerful fellow in his early 30s，pilots Sydney ferryboats for a living. I spent the whole morning shuttling back and forth across the harbor. After our third run Andrew shut down the engine，and we went our separate ways—he for a lunch break，I to explore the city.\n\n“I'll miss these old boats，” he said as we parted.\n\n“How do you mean？” I asked.\n\n“Oh，they're replacing them with catamarans. Catamarans are faster，but they're not so elegant，and they're not fun to pilot. But that's progress，I guess.”\n\nEverywhere in Sydney these days，change and progress are the watchwords (口号)，and traditions are increasingly rare. Shirley Fitzgerald，the city's official historian，told me that in its rush to modernity in the 1970s，Sydney swept aside much of its past，including many of its finest buildings.“Sydney is confused about itself，” she said.“We can't seem to make up our minds whether we want a modern city or a traditional one. It's a conflict that we aren't getting any better at resolving (解决)．”\n\nOn the other hand，being young and old at the same time has its attractions. I considered this when I met a thoughtful young businessman named Anthony.“Many people say that we lack culture in this country，” he told me.“What people forget is that the Italians，when they came to Australia，brought 2,000 years of their culture，the Greeks some 3,000 years，and the Chinese more still. We've got a foundation built on ancient cultures but with a drive and dynamism of a young country. It's a pretty hard combination to beat.”\n\nHe is right，but I can't help wishing they would keep those old ferries.\n\n\n",

"title":"18.3 The Impact of 5G Mobile Technology on the Travel Industry",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"\n5G mobile technology has officially begun rolling out across the globe，which indicates a dynamic acceleration (加速) in our world of connectivity. It promotes operational cooperation tourism hasn't experienced before. It also transforms the travel experience.\nThis is perceived from both the way the industry operates and the side of the traveler.\n\n5G opens up a new way of accessing information and delivering business value. It's expected to offer organizations a wireless network that transforms the way people and machines use data. Unlike previous network generations,5G is now being seen as not just a consumer platform，but a primary communications platform that can also provide cloud connectivity and edge processing that can offer real­time business insights and automated responses，and eventually integrate the billions of Internet of things devices and data that are available.\n\nAs travel companies have transformed their operations with new digital systems，their focus has moved from the technology itself to the improved business outcomes and enhanced guest and passenger experiences driven by the technology. 5G's capabilities can support that change. With advanced connectivity speeds and low latency(延时)，guests can share their personal data to receive custom recommendations from travel companies in real time that should provide meaningful experiences. Virtual experiences give guests an early taste of the destination. For example，guests can involve themselves in viewing rooms and hotel facilities，or preview local attractions as they plan their trips.\n\nTo prepare to roll out this new technology，travel companies should ensure they have a thorough understanding of their guests' expectations on what makes a first­rank travel experience. Then they should find ways to adapt their processes and services to meet them.\n\n\n",

"text":"Great inventors like Thomas Edison have impacted people's lives with their inventions. While their contributions are certainly valuable, the following amazing inventions were actually created by children!\n\n## The trampoline\n\nTrampolines are great for both fun and exercise, but they are a fairly recent invention. In the 1930s, George Nissen was inspired to make a bouncy “net” after seeing a circus performance. He thought it more entertaining for performers to continue bouncing instead of landing in a net. So, at the age of 16, he made it by stretching thick cloth in a metal frame.\n\n## The Popsicle\n\nCold weather led to the creation of a delicious invention—the Popsicle. Frank Epperson was just 11 years old when he accidentally created his first Popsicle. He was making himself a soda drink and left his glass outside overnight. When he found it in the morning, it had frozen solid with the stir stick still in the glass. And the first Popsicle was born.\n\n## Braille\n\nThree-year-old Louis Braille experienced a serious eye injury that blinded him in both eyes. He struggled to read by moving his fingers across raised letters, but that proved very difficult. At the age of twelve, Louis learned about a communication system where messages could be read silently with fingertips. He changed it and created Braille. It's now used around the world!\n\n## BEACON\n\nWhen Hannah Herbst was just 14 years old, she was named America's Top Young Scientist for inventing a device called BEACON. After receiving a letter from her Ethiopian pen pal, Hannah was inspired to create a device that could convert the energy from ocean waves into electricity which she hopes will help people without easy access to electricity.\n\n",

"title":"2.2 The Impact of Selfies on Teenage Girls",
"lastPosi":0.4652529387266455,
"text":"A study of teenage girls' selfie­taking (自拍) behavior found that taking and sharing selfies on social media is not linked to poor body image or appearance concerns. However, when adolescent girls spend too much time struggling over which photo of themselves to post, or rely heavily on editing apps to alter their images, there may be cause for concern.\n\nThe study, by researchers at the University of Arizona(UA), found that selfie editing and time invested in creating and selecting the perfect selfie were both related to self­objectification, which led to body shame, appearance anxiety and more negative appearance evaluations in teen girls.“Self­objectification is the idea that you come to think of yourself as an external object to be viewed by other people,” said senior study author Jennifer Aubrey, an associate professor at the UA.\n\nBased on a study of 278 teenage girls,“Our main finding was that we really shouldn't be too worried about kids who take selfies and share them; that's not where the negative effects come from. It's the investment and the editing that yielded negative effects,” Aubrey said.“Selfie editing and selfie investment predicted self­objectification, and girls who self­objectify were more likely to feel shameful about their bodies or anxious about their appearance.”\n\n“Self­objectification is the pathway to so many things in adolescence that we want to prevent,” Aubrey said.“So, interventions really should focus on how we can encourage girls to develop an awareness of themselves that doesn't only depend on what they look like to other people.” The researchers said parents and caregivers of adolescent girls should be aware that if a teen seems to be obsessed (痴迷的), it might be time for a talk.\n\nThe researchers also note that there can be different motivations for sharing selfies.“Selfies are a part of the media landscape, but you should post them for reasons other than trying to get people to admire your appearance or your body,” Aubrey said. With an estimated 93 million selfies taken each day, they aren't going away anytime soon, nor should they. The important thing to remember is: Selfies aren't bad. Just don't obsess.\n\n7．From which is the text probably taken?\n\nA．A travel brochure.\n\n_B．A science newspaper.\n\nC．A psychology textbook.\n\nD．An entertainment magazine.\n",

"title":"6.2 Akiša Peters: Teaching Dakota Language to Preserve Culture",
"lastPosi":0.4136134878916654,
"text":"At just 19 years old，Akiša Peters teaches at the Sisseton Wahpeton Tribal College. He specializes in a language that is thousands of years old，the Dakota language，spoken by the Dakota people.\n\n“The Dakota language is ‘the most important aspect' of Dakota culture. Without it，our Dakota culture would no longer exist！” Peters claimed.“I was lucky to grow up around many first­language Dakota speakers. But now the elderly continually passed away and at the end of their lives，they just wanted to know their families would continue to have the language. One of the problems our people have is finding ways to get at­length and consistent exposure to the language.”\n\nAside from instructing at the college level，Peters uses social media to share videos that integrate humor，culture，and basic­level conversation to help teach Dakota. In his free time，he visits Dakota elders. He also started an online group of youth to converse and share the knowledge of the language in a safe and supportive space.\n\nAkiša Peters wants to tell the youth that if they want to learn their own language，sit with their elders and learn from them. Endless vocabulary sheets could discourage them from learning. Standards created by non­speakers could also do that.“Within the next decade，I assume，me，my colleagues，and other Dakota­learning relatives will have children and start a new generation of Dakota. I also hope my brothers and sisters will take the path we laid out for them and continue to learn and speak Dakota. On my reservation there are numerous young people working on the comeback of the language. I'm hopeful because I'm definitely not alone，” Akiša Peters told Teen vogue.\n\n\n5．Why does Akiša Peters teach the Dakota language?\n\nA．To enrich his experience.\n\nB．To record its written form.\n\n_C．To prevent it dying out.\n\nD．To make it known globally.\n\n\n6．What can we say about Akiša Peters according to paragraph 3?\n\nA．Learned. \t_B．Creative.\n\nC．Approachable. \tD．Cooperative.\n\n\n7．What does Akiša Peters expect the young people to do?\n\nA．Deal with vocabulary sheets.\n\nB．Sustain the given standards.\n\n_C．Communicate with their elders.\n\nD．Learn from their teachers.\n\n\n8．Which section of a website is the text probably taken from?\n\nA．Research. B．Business.\n\nC．Fashion. _D．Culture.\n\n",

"title":"4.3 Active Schools Framework: A PE Teacher's Journey",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"As a young boy, I loved being active. All I really wanted to do was to put on my football shoes and play out with my friends. As I've got older, my love for physical activity hasn't declined. This is why I was so eager to be involved in the Creating Active Schools framework as a PE teacher.\n\nIn the early stages of my time at Peel Park Primary, my two main aims were to reform the PE course and to increase our participation in competitive sports. We achieved these successfully in a short time.\n\nJust as I'll never love art, many of our pupils will never love football or tennis. That's why finding a way to move, which works for each child, is vital. What we can do is get opportunities for every child to love being physically active.\n\nWe therefore opened our own school Bike Library. We have already received many rental requests. We also thought about how to arrange the school day, allowing all children to access our equipment freely and easily. Besides, we also have a “PA” lesson which has a total free choice for the children. They can swing on the trees, go on the bikes and play games with their friends. This change from thinking has improved participation in the “traditional PE” from pupils, who typically didn't love sports. A win­win situation!\n\nNow I'm looking forward to our next step on this journey to improving pupils' lives. The potential of this project as it expands, is huge.",

"lastPosi":0.16316410501563422,
"text":"Twelve prized camels have been disqualified from a beauty contest in Saudi Arabia after their owners tried to beautify their looks with Botox (肉毒杆菌素)．\n\nThousands of camels are paraded at the King Abdulaziz Camel Festival to be judged on their shapely lips and humps. The festival，which also features camel racing and camel milk tasting，has combined prize money of $57 million.\n\nThis year's event has been stuck in scandal after the 20 million Saudi riyals in prize money for each category tempted some owners to cheat.\n\nThe key features in camel beauty are considered to be delicate ears and a big nose. Judges are also looking for perfectly placed humps，muscular physiques and leathery mouths. But there are strict rules against the use of drugs in the lips，or shaved or clipped body parts.\n\nAli Al Mazrouei，the son of a top Emirati breeder，said Botox was used for the lips，the nose and even the jaw.“It makes the head more inflated，so when the camel comes，it's like ‘Oh look at how big that head is. It has big lips，a big nose’，” he said.\n\nIn the lead up to the festival，Saudi media reported that a vet had been caught giving camels plastic surgery including Botox injections and reducing the size of their ears.\n\nChief judge Fawzan Al­Madi said the camel was “a symbol of Saudi Arabia”．“We used to preserve it out of necessity; now we preserve it as a pastime，” he said. The camel beauty contest was first held in 2000 and last year was relocated from a remote desert area to a permanent venue north of the capital，Riyadh.\n\n4．Why did some people cheat in the camel beauty contest?\n\n_A．Because they wanted to get the big prize.\n\nB．Because they intended to show off their camels.\n\nC．Because they were proud of their camels' humps.\n\nD．Because they expected their camels to win in racing.\n\n5．What is focused in the fourth paragraph?\n\nA．The goal of the contest.\n\nB．The rules for the judges.\n\n_C．The standards of judgement.\n\nD．The kinds of different camels.\n\n\n6．Which of the following isn't considered a feature of camel beauty?\n\nA．Big lips.　　　　　　　\t_B．Big ears.\n\nC．Big heads. \tD．Big noses.\n\n\n7．What can we infer from the last paragraph?\n\nA．Arabians find it tiring to raise camels.\n\nB．People in Saudi Arabia depend on camels to live.\n\n_C．Saudi government takes the camel festival seriously.\n\nD．Camels were raised for fun in the past in Saudi Arabia.\n",

"title":"16.1 Do we still need cash?",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"Do we still need cash? The days of holding notes in our hands may be numbered. The advancement of technology and the increase of new electronic and mobile devices in today's world are set to revolutionize how we make payments. With a click of a mobile phone app，our entire wealth is literally at our fingertips. As digital forms are increasingly replacing cash payments，some think that we should become fully cash­free. However，I do not believe we should move towards a completely cash­free society.\n\nOne of the main concerns of a cashless world is the risk of a cheat and ridiculously，the inconvenience that follows. The instant content that accompanies cashless transactions (交易) could be compromised by online security issues. Technology experts argue that our current state of technology is unable to provide a secure cashless environment that could prevent people from accessing the system illegally and abusing the personal data. In addition，many online shopping sites lack strong systems that would protect their customers' personal information. Occasionally，when an account is “locked” due to a suspected cheating activity, having cash in hand becomes critical. In a cashless society，a victim of cheating would find himself locked out of his account and unable to have access to his money until the case is solved. Going cash­free causes great inconvenience in this case.\n\nAnother reason is that mankind might potentially become less thrifty (节俭的). Paying in cash causes a psychological pain on consumers so that they are more cautious in their spending. As it is，cashless payments have already eased that pain somewhat. Thus，an even more careless digital payment could make us much less thrifty.\n\nThe idea of a cashless society is a very real，or even an exciting one. However，to safeguard the interests of all users，it is better to soften our enthusiasm—perhaps to be a less­cash society rather than a completely cashless one is a better option.\n\n",

"title":"14.2 The Tradition of Fur Skis in Altay, Xinjiang",
"lastPosi":0.6293542193806568,
"text":"In some snow­covered villages in Altay district of Xinjiang，it's common in winter to see local herdsmen (牧民) with planks attached to their feet climb the snowy slopes without any other form of assistance. The pair of planks are wrapped with horsehide (马皮)，which serves a double purpose. Remarkably，the horsehide not only can provide friction to prevent skiers from slipping while going up the hills，but also helps them slide more smoothly down the hills.\n\nAccording to rock carvings uncovered in the area by archaeologists，such skis have served for around 12,000 years as a means of transportation for the snowfield people of Altay，especially those who had to travel a long way in the snow to herd animals or hunt. The fur skis gradually lost their popularity in recent decades after paved roads linked houses to the outside world. However，in response to the nation's goal of brightening up grassroots enthusiasm for ice and snow sports，Altay plans to protect and promote its skiing culture and better pass along its skiing tradition to future generations.\n\nSilambek Sakish,67，a herdsman in the village of Altay，began to learn the craft at the age of 15 from his father. He would cut high­quality pine into a plank and then bend the plank's front end after the wood was heated in a fire. Wrapping the plank with horsehide was the last step.\n\nSakish was honored as an heritor of the craft of making fur skis in 2010，which had been assigned as an intangible (非物质) cultural heritage of Xinjiang. His works are exhibited in ski places，airports and train stations across Altay and also at the display center for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics to promote the district's deep historical connection to skiing. More young people have come to him to learn the craft，and his youngest son，who is 31，has followed in his footsteps to carry on the tradition.\n\n\n\n",

"lastPosi":0.26615266939632326,
"text":"Many people think that there should be some sort of universal service around cash，forcing banks to provide it and sellers to accept it. I disagree，but I do understand why they think that forcing the additional costs associated with cash on financial institutions and merchants seems appealing.\n\nOne of their arguments is that cash is a necessary fallback，the only payment method that society can depend on in the event of nuclear war or natural disaster and therefore businesses should be forced to keep the ability to distribute and collect notes and coins. They think that cash is the backup in a disaster. It really isn't. When things go really wrong，it is the people who keep their money in cash who suffer the most.\n\nRemember the Japanese disaster of a decade back，where following a severe earthquake off the northeast coast of Japan's Honshu Island in 2011，a huge tsunami (海啸) towering a hundred feet above the ground went crashing into cities，towns and villages destroying more than 500 square kilometers. Since Japan remains a cash­based society and a great many people keep their savings in cash in their homes，the disaster led to the unusual phenomenon of safes and cash washing up on beaches. Yasuo Kimura，a former bank employee then aged 67，said that he had many friends who lost everything.“I had tried to convince them to put their money in a bank，” he said.“They always thought it was safer to keep it at home.”\n\nAnother argument they make is that electronic payment can be bad for privacy，making cash remain the best backup. They ask “How do you stop data thieves and data brokers from monitoring your buying history？” and suggest paying in cash is the answer. Personally，I think using privacy-enhancing technologies when making electronic payments is a better answer，but that's a discussion for another day.\n\n5．What makes many people think it necessary to force cash service on banks?\n\nA．The duty of banks.\n\n_B．The reliability of cash.\n\nC．The need to cut costs.\n\nD．The demand from sellers.\n\n\n6．What was one of the results of the Japanese disaster in 2011?\n\nA．The quake destroyed over 500 square kilometers.\n\nB．100 towers were swallowed by the tsunami.\n\nC．Japanese started to keep money in banks.\n\n_D．Many Japanese lost their backup money.\n\n\n7．What does the author think of electronic payment?\n\nA．It is not good for privacy.\n\n_B．It still leaves much to be desired.\n\nC．It is safer than cash payment.\n\nD．It often falls into the wrong hands.\n\n\n8．What can be the best title for the text?\n\nA．Is E­payment Safe?\n\nB．Lessons from a Natural Disaster\n\n_C．Is Cash the Backup?\n\nD．Appeal of Universal Cash Service\n",

"title":"17.1 Biography of Edward O. Wilson",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"Edward O. Wilson, known as “ant man”， was born on June 10, 1929, in Birmingham, Alabama. His parents divorced when he was young, and he was moved frequently throughout his childhood. Wilson grew up exploring the forests and wildlife. One of these adventures left him partly blind, but they also set off his lifelong fascination with ants and their social structures.\n\nWilson earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Alabama. In 1955, he received his Ph. D. from Harvard and worked there until retirement.\n\nWilson's early study of ants led to his first major discovery in 1959: how ants communicate through the release of chemical signals.\n\nLater, in 1990, Wilson and German biologist Bert Hölldobler published their Pulitzer­winning The Ants. It detailed the insects' social structure that was both valued by scholars and accessible to general readers.\n\nAnother of Wilson's major works started in the early 1960s when he teamed up with Robert MacArthur. The pair published The Theory of Island Biogeography, where they sought to explain why different places have different numbers of species.\n\nWhat many consider to be Wilson's most important contributions to evolutionary biology came in 1975 when he published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The work explored the genetic roots of animal behavior and argued that genes shaped human behavior.\n\nWilson faced accusations for these ideas but his work finally largely proved true. In 1978, his ideas on the role biology plays in human culture peaked in On Human Nature, which won him a Pulitzer in 1979.\n\nWilson published more than 400 scientific papers and 30 books. These accomplishments offered him a type of superstar status, but friends and colleagues said the polite Southerner remained down to earth. “Professor Wilson really listened to and engaged with whomever he was interacting with，”said Corrie S. Moreau, who was one of Wilson's final advisees.\n",

"title":"18.1 A wearable interactive display made of a flexible electronic fabric",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"\nA wearable interactive display made of a flexible，breathable electronic fabric can display simple maps and text messages，potentially for use in future smart clothing，a research group reports in their latest paper.\n\nPrevious research has developed flexible thin­film displays that are rollable，foldable and stretchable. However，such electronics have not yet been successfully integrated into clothing. This is because it has proven challenging to design fabric displays that are both durable over time and easy to assemble over a large area.\n\nNow，Chinese scientists have woven bands of a new fabric display roughly 6 m long by 25 cm wide. To make the new fabric，polymer scientists Chen Peining and Peng Huisheng at Fudan University in Shanghai and their colleagues weave electrically transparent fibers into a flexible，breathable fabric. The fabric is about as bright as the average flat­screen TV. The researchers noted their prototype (雏形) was also significantly more durable than conventional flexible thin­film displays，making it more suitable for practical use. One likely application for this is wearable displays. The researchers integrated a touch­sensitive 16­button fabric keyboard，solar­energy­harvesting threads and battery fibers into their fabric to add interactivity and a power supply. They added electronics to wirelessly link it to a smartphone via a Bluetooth connection so users could send and receive messages on their sleeves，as well as see their real­time locations on a map.\n\nIn the future，smart clothing might help display messages from people with voice，speech and language problems. And it might even work in concert with devices that can decode (译解) complex brain waves to figure out what these people would like to say but cannot. However，“putting displays with 36 volts (伏特) directly on the body may potentially be a concern，” cautioned Bao，chemical engineer at Stanford University in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

"title":"13.2 Popular Beliefs Regarding Emotional Intelligence",
"lastPosi":0.360929237373779,
"text":"Popularization has in some cases changed the original meaning of emotional (情感的) intelligence. Many people now misunderstand emotional intelligence as almost everything desirable in a person's makeup that cannot be measured by an IQ test，such as character，motivation，confidence，mental stability，optimism and “people skills”. Research has shown that emotional skills may contribute to some of these qualities，but most of them move far beyond skill­based emotional intelligence.\n\nWe prefer to describe emotional intelligence as a specific set of skills that can be used for either good or bad purposes. The ability to accurately understand how others are feeling may be used by a doctor to find how best to help her patients，while a cheater might use it to control potential victims. Being emotionally intelligent does not necessarily make one a moral person.\n\nAlthough popular beliefs regarding emotional intelligence run far ahead of what research can reasonably support，the overall effects of the publicity have been more beneficial than harmful. The most positive aspect of this popularization is a new and much needed emphasis on emotion by employers，educators and others interested in promoting social well­being. The popularization of emotional intelligence has helped both the public and researchers reevaluate the functionality of emotions and how they serve people adaptively in everyday life.\n\nAlthough the continuing popular appeal of emotional intelligence is desirable，we hope that such attention will excite a greater interest in the scientific and scholarly study of emotion. It is our hope that in coming decades，advances in science will offer new perspectives (视角) from which to study how people manage their lives. Emotional intelligence，with its focus on both head and heart，may serve to point us in the right direction.\n\n\n5．What is a common misunderstanding of emotional intelligence?\n\nA．It can be measured by an IQ test.\n\nB．It helps to exercise a person's mind.\n\nC．It includes a set of emotional skills.\n\n_D．It refers to a person's positive qualities.\n\n\n6．Why does the author mention “doctor” and “cheater” in paragraph 2?\n\nA．To explain a rule.\n\n_B．To clarify a concept.\n\nC．To present a fact.\n\nD．To make a prediction.\n\n\n7．What is the author's attitude to the popularization of emotional intelligence?\n\n_A．Favorable. \tB．Intolerant.\n\nC．Doubtful. \tD．Unclear.\n\n\n8．What does the last paragraph mainly talk about concerning emotional intelligence?\n\nA．Its appeal to the public.\n\n_B．Expectations for future studies.\n\nC．Its practical application.\n\nD．Scientists with new perspectives.\n",

"lastPosi":0.2841178074070287,
"text":"According to the statistics shared by UNESCO，at least 43% of the total languages that are estimated as being spoken across the world are in danger of extinction. Moreover，many languages around the world have less than 1,000 speakers now. Linguists (语言学家) and researchers believe that by the end of the century，at least half of the world's languages will have died. This is troublesome，given that cultural identity and languages go hand in hand.\n\nLanguage activists and people who speak these endangered languages are fighting back tooth and nail. Scientists believe that digitalization might be our only hope to preserve some of these quickly disappearing languages in the online world.\n\nFor instance，Oxford University Press launched Oxford Global Languages a few years ago. It is an initiative that boosts “digitally underrepresented” languages. They are focused on promoting languages that might have close to a million speakers worldwide，yet have little or no online presence. Therefore，they have been creating digital dictionaries as a fundamental building block to help preserve them.\n\nThere have been countless other projects like this with the same aim. Another is the Rosetta Project，which aims to create a handheld digital library that will carry more than 1,500 languages. It will be appropriately sized to fit nicely into our hands，and will come with around 13,000 pages of information. It will also have a high life expectancy of anywhere between 2,000 and 10,000 years. Initiatives like these have as their primary objective to ensure the preservation of local languages long after their speakers have died.\n\nCountless languages are dying every day，and they will continue to perish as the remaining speakers die. Of course，we cannot merely rely on digitization to deal with worldwide language loss. However，it is a step in the right direction. These digital tools offer endangered languages an opportunity to bounce back and survive.\n\n\n1．What does the data in paragraph 1 mainly show?\n\n_A．Many languages are endangered.\n\nB．Culture determines language evolution.\n\nC．Human development results in fewer languages.\n\nD．Many linguists attempt to protect threatened languages.\n\n\n2．What does Oxford Global Languages try to do?\n\nA．Promote online courses of local languages.\n\nB．Publish paper dictionaries of global languages.\n\nC．Increase dying language speakers to a million.\n\n_D．Make certain languages available in digital form.\n\n\n3．What can we learn about the digital library to be created by the Rosetta Project?\n\nA．It is portable but has a short life.\n\nB．It is sponsored by Oxford University Press.\n\n_C．It provides protection for linguistic diversity.\n\nD．It contains automatically updated information.\n\n4．Which of the following can replace the underlined word “perish” in the last paragraph?\n\nA．Be enriched.\n_B．Be lost.\nC．Be acquired. \nD．Be invented\n",

"title":"5.3 Strategies for Spending Less Time Worrying about Decisions",
"lastPosi":0.3801749206429731,
"text":"If you're an un­decider，even the simplest decisions can make your pulse race. And big, life­changing choices can cause a state of breaking down. Here are some strategies for spending less time worrying about decisions.\n\n## Go for being good enough\n\nSince perfectionism and indecision often go hand in hand, you should be moving from a mindset that “only the best will do” to “being good enough is good enough”. It helps to reflect on your original goal. Did you begin the exhausting online shopping to find a toaster that could clean itself, roast carrots and also charge your cell phone? Or were you just looking for something that would brown your bread？Remembering your purpose can simplify the process.\n\n## Outsource (交外办理) decisions\n\nResearch has shown that choices weaken the willpower and lead to decision fatigue (疲劳). That's why indecisive people are advised to pick their “battles”．In other words, be choosy about choosing. When it comes to wine, for example, all I want is a good glass with dinner. So rather than studying which to choose, I leave the decision to my local wine store，asking it to send me a case of surprises once in a while.\n\n## The 90 percent rule\n\nWhen a yes­or­no decision has many pros and cons, try the “90 percent rule”. This involves evaluating an opportunity on a scale from 0 to 100. If your interest falls anywhere below 90 percent, reduce its score to zero and reject it. Think about how you'd feel if you scored 65 points on some test. Why would you deliberately choose to feel that way about an important choice in your life?\n\n## Cut through the fog\n\nIf you're deciding whether to move across the country, imagine you've asked your best friend to choose for you. On the big day, she hands you an envelope；inside, it announces you're leaving next month. Do you feel excited? Or disappointed? Using thought experiments to separate important variables can help you cut through the fog to see clarity\n",

"title":"17.2 The Life of Sophia Behrs: A Vital Contribution to Tolstoy's Work",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"\nFor people born into the Russian aristocracy (贵族) in the nineteenth century，life was full of interesting opportunities unless they were female. At the time，women generally did not have careers，for they were expected，instead，to focus fully on marrying and raising families. Sophia Behrs was one such young woman. When Sophia married Leo Tolstoy (列夫·托尔斯泰)，he was already a well­known author. Both the couple were literary in their interests：Sophia had been a gifted student and，even at a very young age，was a keen and sensitive reader.\n\nSophia's marriage to Tolstoy gave her the opportunity to put her abilities as a good reader to use，often advising him on his work throughout the writing process. She served as her husband's copyist，writing out multiple copies of his novels by hand. She made suggestions for and edits to his work，many of which were incorporated into the final product. In addition，she served as his manager，publicist，and agent，keeping track of the financial and legal sides of her husband's writing career. If Sophia were alive today，she might have found her calling at a publishing house or literary­agency.\n\nShe wrote her own Russian­language grammar textbook and translated texts from German and English. She also wrote fiction，including a revision of Leo's novella The Kreutzer Sonata. In that story，a man recounts the dramatic breakdown of his marriage；Sophia retold the narrative from his wife's point of view. The famous writer was impressed by his wife's literary talents.“What force of truth and simplicity！” he wrote in his diary upon reading one of her stories.\n\nHowever，Sophia never sought publication for her own work. Writing was not a fantasy that she look seriously；rather，she regarded it with “a certain contempt (轻蔑) and irony.” Limited by personal modesty，her domestic duties，and the expectations for women in her lifetime，Sophia never even considered seeking fame of her own. Yet Tolstoy would never have been able to produce the work he did without Sophia's vital contributions.\n\n",

"text":"Space tourism is the term used to describe space travel for recreational or leisure purposes. What was once only a dream，as described in A Space Odyssey by Arthur C．Clarke，is now becoming a reality.\n\nFuturologists attempt to make predictions of what life will be like in the future. After the first man landed on the moon，they thought that hotels would be built on the moon by the year 2000. They also considered the possibility that，in the 21st century，families might go for a holiday on the moon. Neither of these predictions have come true yet—but the rapid development of technology may mean these predictions are possible in the years to come.\n\nSpace Adventures is currently the only company to have succeeded in sending paying passengers into space. It worked with the Federal Space Agency of Russia and Rocket and Space Corporation Energia to provide flights for the world's first private space explorers. Each paid over $20 million for their 10­day trip to the International Space Station.\n\nFollowing successful explorations into space，other companies are now considering the possibility of enabling tourists to visit space. To make it affordable，suborbital space travel is being considered by some companies，like Virgin Galactic. Passengers would be transported to a height of between 100 and 160 km above earth，experience 3－6 minutes of weightlessness and a view of the stars，then come back down to earth. This is expected to cost around $200,000 per person.\n\nWhile it could be an enriching experience，there are some disadvantages. Many critics say that a huge growth in the spaceflight industry could drastically speed up the process of global warming. The ozone layer would be damaged further and the polar regions would suffer. In addition，space travel is only really affordable for the super­rich，though Virgin Galactic claims to be “opening space to the rest of us”．\n\n\n\n1．What do you know about space tourism?\n\nA．It is nothing but a dream.\n\nB．It's only in some fairy tales.\n\n_C．It's a sightseeing tour in space.\n\nD．It's a scientific expedition.\n\n\n\n2．What is paragraph 2 mainly about?\n\nA．The future life on the moon.\n\nB．Landing on the moon in 1969.\n\n_C．Predictions about trips to the moon.\n\nD．The history of the moon exploration.\n\n\n\n3．Why is suborbital space travel considered possible?\n\n_A．It's cheaper.　　　　\tB．It's safer.\n\nC．It's greener. \tD．It's convenient.\n\n\n\n4．What is some critics' major concern about space tourism?\n\nA．Its safety.\n\n_B．Environmental effect.\n\nC．Social equality.\n\nD．Its expense.\n",

"title":"1. A Puma at large",
"lastPosi":0.6235950550159535,
"text":"Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.\nThe hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.\n",

"text":"The great ship, Titanic, sailed for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1,316 passengers and a crew of 891. Even by modern standards, the 46,000 ton Titanic was a colossal ship. At the time, however, she was not only the largest ship that had ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments. Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heavy loss of life.\nFour days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, huge iceberg was suddenly spotted by a lookout. After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her. Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened. The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded! The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everybody, 1,500 lives were lost.\n",

"text":"Customs Officers are quite tolerant these days, but they can still stop you when you are going through the Green Channel and have nothing to declare. Even really honest people are often made to feel guilty.

Perfume is not exempt from import duty.'\n'But it isn't perfume,' I said. 'It's hair gel.' Then I added with a smile, 'It's a strange mixture I make myself.'\nAs I expected, he did not believe me.\n'Try it!' I said encouragingly.\nThe officer unscrewed the cap and put the bottle to his nostrils. He was greeted by an unpleasant smell which convinced him that I was telling the truth. A few minutes later, I was able to hurry away with precious chalk marks on my baggage.\n",

The towers are built on immense underwater platforms make of steel and concrete. The platforms extend to a depth of over 100 feet under the sea. These alone took sixteen months to build. Above the surface of the water, the towers rise to a height of nearly 700 feet. They support the cables from which the bridge has been suspended. Each of the four cables contains 26,108 lengths of wire. It has been estimated that if the bridge were packed with cars, it would still only be carrying a third of its total capacity. However, size and strength are not the only important things about this bridge.

It marked the end of the great tradition of ships with sails and the beginning of a new era.\nThe first of the two ships to reach Java after the race had begun was the Thermopylae, but on the Indian Ocean, the Cutty Sark took lead. It seemed certain that she would be the first ship home, but during the race she had a lot of bad luck. In August, she was struck by a very heavy storm during which her rudder was torn away. The Cutty Sark rolled from side to side and it became impossible to steer her. A temporary rudder was made on board from spare planks and it was fitted with great difficulty. This greatly reduced the speed of the ship, for there was a danger that if she traveled too quickly, this rudder would be torn away as well. Because of this, the Cutty Sark lost her lead. After crossing the Equator, the captain called in at a port to have a new rudder fitted, but by now the Thermopylae was over five hundred miles ahead.

Though it may be possible to measure the value of material good in terms of money, it is extremely difficult to estimate the true value of the services which people perform for us. There are times when we would willingly give everything we possess to save our lives, yet we might grudge paying a surgeon a high fee for offering us precisely this service. The conditions of society are such that skills have to be paid for in the same way that goods are paid for at a shop. Everyone has something to sell.\nTramps seem to be the only exception to this general rule. Beggars almost sell themselves as human being to arouse the pity of passers-by. But real tramps are not beggars. They have nothing to sell and require nothing from others. In seeking independence, they do not sacrifice their human dignity. A tramp may ask you for money, but he will never ask you to feel sorry for him. He has deliberately chosen to lead the life he leads and is fully aware of the consequences. He may never be sure where the next meal is coming from, but his is free from the thousands of anxieties which afflict other people. His few material possessions make it possible for him to move from place to place with ease. By having to sleep in the open, he gets far closer to the world of nature than most of us ever do.

A Frenchman, for instance, might find it hard to laugh at a Russian joke. In the same way, a Russian might fail to see anything amusing in a joke witch would make an Englishman laugh to tears.\nMost funny stories are based on comic situations. In spite of national differences, certain funny situations have a universal appeal. No matter where you live, you would find it difficult not to laugh at, say, Charlie Chaplin's early films. However, a new type of humour, which stems largely from the U.S., has recently come into fashion. It is called 'sick humour'. Comedians base their jokes on tragic situation like violent death or serious accidents. Many people find this sort of joke distasteful The following example of 'sick humour' will enable you to judge for yourself.\nA man who had broken his right leg was taken to hospital a few weeks before Christmas. From the moment he arrived there, he kept on pestering his doctor to tell him when he would be able to go home. He dreaded having to spend Christmas in hospital. Though the doctors did his best, the patient's recovery was slow. On Christmas Day, the man still had his right leg in plaster. He spent a miserable day in bed thinking of all the fun he was missing. The following day, however, the doctor consoled him by telling him that his chances of being able to leave hospital in time for New Year celebrations were good. The good. The man took heart and, sure enough, on New Years' Eve he was able to hobble along to a party. To compensate for his unpleasant experiences in hospital, the man drank a little more than was good for him. In the process, he enjoyed himself thoroughly and kept telling everybody how much he hated hospitals. He was still mumbling something about hospitals at the end of the party when he slipped on a piece of ice and broke his left leg.\n",

"text":"Some time ago, and interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini. The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization. Houses -- often three storeys high -- were built of stone. They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.\nThe temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found. Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted. The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C. This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman. She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.\n",

Every time a worker gave up his job, he told the same story. Farm labourers said that they always woke up to find that work had been done overnight. Hay had been cut and cowsheds had been cleaned. A farm worker, who stayed up all night claimed to have seen a figure cutting corn in the moonlight. In time, it became an accepted fact the Cox brothers employed a conscientious ghost that did most of their work for them.\nNo one suspected that there might be someone else on the farm who had never been seen. This was indeed the case. A short time ago, villagers were astonished to learn that the ghost of Endley had died. Everyone went to the funeral, for the 'ghost' was none other than Eric Cox, a third brother who was supposed to have died as a young man. After the funeral, Joe and Bob revealed a secret which they had kept for over fifty years.\nEric had been the eldest son of the family, very much older than his two brothers. He had been obliged to join the army during the Second World War. As he hated army life, he decided to desert his regiment. When he learnt that he would be sent abroad, he returned to the farm and his father hid him until the end of the war. Fearing the authorities, Eric remained in hiding after the war as well. His father told everybody that Eric had been killed in action. The only other people who knew the secret were Joe and Bob. They did not even tell their wives. When their father died, they thought it their duty to keep Eric in hiding. All these years, Eric had lived as a recluse. He used to sleep during the day and work at night, quite unaware of the fact that he had become the ghost of Endley. When he died, however, his brothers found it impossible to keep the secret any longer.\n",

This invariably wins them the love and respect of others, for they add colour to the dull routine of everyday life.\nUp to the time of his death, Richard Colson was one of the most notable figures in our town. He was a shrewd and wealthy businessman, but most people in the town hardly knew anything about this side of his life. He was known to us all as Dickie and his eccentricity had become legendary long before he died.\nDickie disliked snobs intensely. Though he owned a large car, he hardly ever used it, preferring always to go on foot. Even when it was raining heavily, he refused to carry an umbrella. One day, he walked into an expensive shop after having been caught in a particularly heavy shower. He wanted to buy a $300 watch for his wife, but he was in such a bedraggled condition than an assistant refused to serve him. Dickie left the shop without a word and returned carrying a large cloth bag. As it was extremely heavy, he dumped it on the counter. The assistant asked him to leave, but Dickie paid no attention to him and requested to see the manager. Recognizing who the customer was, the manager was most apologetic and reprimanded the assistant severely. When Dickie was given the watch, the presented the assistant with the cloth bag. It contained $300 in pennies. He insisted on the assistant's counting the money before he left -- 30,000 pennies in all! On another occasion, he invited a number of important critics to see his private collection of modern paintings. This exhibition received a great deal of attention in the press, for though the pictures were supposed to be the work of famous artists, they had in fact been painted by Dickie. It took him four years to stage this elaborate joke simply to prove that critics do not always know what they are talking about.\n",

A radio message from the mainland had been received by the ship's captain instructing him to give up the search. The captain knew that another attempt would be made later, for the sunken ship he was trying to find had been carrying a precious cargo of gold bullion.\nDespite the message, the captain of the Elkor decided to try once more. The sea bed was scoured with powerful nets and there was tremendous excitement on board went a chest was raised from the bottom. Though the crew were at first under the impression that the lost ship had been found, the contents of the chest proved them wrong. What they had in fact found was a ship which had been sunk many years before.\nThe chest contained the personal belongings of a seaman, Alan Fielding. There were books, clothing and photographs, together with letters which the seaman had once received from his wife. The captain of the Elkor ordered his men to salvage as much as possible from the wreck. Nothing of value was found, but the numerous items which were brought to the surface proved to be of great interest. From a heavy gun that was raised, the captain realized that the ship must have been a cruiser. In another chest, which contained the belongings of a ship's officer, there was an unfinished letter which had been written on March 14th, 1943. The captain learnt from the letter that the name of the lost ship was the Karen. The most valuable find of all was the ship's log book, parts of which it was still possible to read. From this the captain was able to piece together all the information that had come to light. The Karen had been sailing in a convoy to Russia when she was torpedoed by an enemy submarine. This was later confirmed by naval official at the Ministry of Defiance after the Elkor had returned home. All the items that were found were sent to the War Museum.\n",

Let us suppose that you are preparing a meal and keeping an eye on the baby at the same time. The telephone rings and this marks the prelude to an unforeseen series of catastrophes. While you are on the phone, the baby pulls the tablecloth off the table, smashing half your best crockery and cutting himself in the process. You hang up hurriedly and attend to baby, crockery, etc. Meanwhile, the meal gets burnt. As if this were not enough to reduce you to tears, your husband arrives, unexpectedly bringing three guests to dinner.\nThings can go wrong on a big scale, as a number of people recently discovered in Parramatta, a suburb of Sydney. During the rush hour one evening two cars collided and both drivers began to argue. The woman immediately behind the two cars happened to be a learner. She suddenly got into a panic and stopped her car. This made the driver following her brake hard. His wife was sitting beside him holding a large cake. As she was thrown forward, the cake went right through the windscreen and landed on the road. Seeing a cake flying through the air, a lorry driver who was drawing up alongside the car, pulled up all of a sudden. The lorry was loaded with empty beer bottles and hundreds of them slid off the back of the vehicle and on to the road. This led to yet another angry argument. Meanwhile, the traffic piled up behind. It took the police nearly an hour to get the traffic on the move again. In the meantime, the lorry driver had to sweep up hundreds of broken bottles. Only two stray dogs benefited from all this confusion, for they greedily devoured what was left of the cake. It was just one of those days!\n",

But no one has to muster up courage to enter a less pretentious antique shop. There is always hope that in its labyrinth of musty, dark, disordered rooms a real rarity will be found amongst the piles of assorted junk that little the floors.\nNo one discovers a rarity by chance. A truly dedicated bargain hunter must have patience, and above all, the ability to recognize the worth of something when he sees it. To do this, he must be at least as knowledgeable as the dealer. Like a scientist bent on making a discovery, he must cherish the hope that one day he will be amply rewarded.\nMy old friend, Frank Halliday, is just such a person. He has often described to me how he picked up a masterpiece for a mere $50. One Saturday morning, Frank visited an antique shop in my neighbourhood. As he had never been there before, he found a great deal to interest him. The morning passed rapidly and Frank was about to leave when he noticed a large packing case lying on the floor. The morning passed rapidly and Frank just come in, but that he could not be bothered to open it. Frank begged him to do so and the dealer reluctantly prised it open. The contents were disappointing. Apart from an interesting-looking carved dagger, the box was full of crockery, much of it broken. Frank gently lifted the crockery out of the box an suddenly noticed a miniature painting at the bottom of the packing case. As its composition and line reminded him of an Italian painting he knew well, he decided to buy it. Glancing at it briefly, the dealer told him that it was worth $50. Frank could hardly conceal his excitement, for he knew that he had made a real discovery. The tiny painting proved to be an unknown masterpiece by Correggio and was worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n",

Justice is part of the complex machinery of the law. Those who seek it undertake an arduous journey and can never be sure that they will find it. Judges, however wise or eminent, are human and can make mistakes.\nThere are rare instances when justice almost ceases to be an abstract concept. Reward or punishment are meted out quite independent of human interference. At such times, justice acts like a living force. When we use a phrase like 'it serves him right', we are, in part, admitting that a certain set of circumstances has enabled justice to act of its own accord.\nWhen a thief was caught on the premises of large jewellery store on morning, the shop assistants must have found it impossible to resist the temptation to say 'it serves him right.' The shop was an old converted house with many large, disused fireplaces and tall, narrow chimneys. Towards midday, a girl heard a muffed cry coming from behind on of the walls. As the cry was repeated several times, she ran to tell the manager who promptly rang up the fire brigade. The cry had certainly come form one of the chimneys, but as there were so many of them, the fire fighters could not be certain which one it was. They located the right chimney by tapping at the walls and listening for the man's cries. After chipping through a wall which was eighteen inches thick, they found that a man had been trapped in the chimney. As it was extremely narrow, the man was unable to move, but the fire fighters were eventually able to free him by cutting a huge hole in the wall. The sorry-looking, blackened figure that emerged, admitted at once that he had tried to break into the shop during the night but had got stuck in the chimney. He had been there for nearly ten hours. Justice had been done even before the man was handed over to the police.\n",

"text":"We are less credulous than we used to be. In the nineteenth century, a novelist would bring his story to a conclusion by presenting his readers with a series of coincidences -- most of them wildly improbable. Readers happily accepted the fact that an obscure maidservant was really the hero's mother. A long-lost brother, who was presumed dead, was really alive all the time and wickedly plotting to bring about the hero's downfall. And so on. Modern readers would find such naive solution totally unacceptable. Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible.\nWhen I was a boy, my grandfather told me how a German taxi driver, Franz Bussman, found a brother who was thought to have been killed twenty years before. While on a walking tour with his wife, he stooped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman commented on the workman's close resemblance to her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz poured scorn on the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busssman fully acquainted with this story, she thought that there was a chance in a million that she might be right. A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman and he really was Franz's long-lost brother. When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. After having been wounded towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit. The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his family home, but the house had been bombed and no one in the neighbourhood knew what had become of the inhabitants. Assuming that his family had been killed during an air raid, Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.\n",

Ships may be delayed by storms; flights may be cancelled because of bad weather, but trains must be on time. Only an exceptionally heavy snowfall might temporarily dislocate railway services. It is all too easy to blame the railway authorities when something does go wrong. The truth is that when mistakes occur, they are more likely to be ours than theirs.\nAfter consulting my railway timetable, I noted with satisfaction that there was an express train to Westhaven. It went direct from my local station and the journey lasted mere hour and seventeen minutes. When I boarded the train, I could not help noticing that a great many local people got on as well. At the time, this did not strike me as odd. I reflected that there must be a great many local people besides myself who wished to take advantage of this excellent service. Neither was I surprise when the train stopped at Widley, a tiny station a few miles along the line. Even a mighty express train can be held up by signals. But when the train dawdled at station after station, I began to wonder, It suddenly dawned on me that this express was not roaring down the line at ninety miles an hour, but barely chugging along at thirty. One hour and seventeen minutes passed and we had not even covered half the distance. I asked a passenger if this was the Westhaven Express, but he had not even heard of it. I determined to lodge a complaint as soon as we arrived. Two hours later, I was talking angrily to the station master at Westhaven. When he denied the train's existence, I borrowed his copy of the timetable. There was a note of triumph in my voice when I told him that it was there in black and white. Glancing at it briefly, he told me to look again. A tiny asterisk conducted me to a footnote at the bottom of the page. It said: 'This service has been suspended.'\n",

Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMS are just some of the bewildering amount of information they will have. They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action. But the historian attempting to reconstruct the distant past is always faced with a difficult task. He has to deduce what he can from the few scanty clues available. Even seemingly insignificant remains can shed interesting light on the history of early man.\nUp to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the advent of agriculture, for then man was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons. Recent scientific evidence seems to indicate that this assumption is incorrect.\nHistorians have long been puzzled by dots, lines and symbols which have been engraved on walls, bones, and the ivory tusks of mammoths. The nomads who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age which began about 35,000 B.C. and ended about 10,000 B.C. By correlating markings made in various parts of the world, historians have been able to read this difficult code. They have found that it is connected with the passage of days and the phases of the moon. It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar. It has long been known that the hunting scenes depicted on walls were not simply a form of artistic expression. They had a definite meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing. It is possible that there is a definite relation between these paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them. It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed.\n",

Why people are prepared to tolerate a four-hour journey each day for the dubious privilege of living in the country is beyond me. They could be saved so much misery and expense if they chose to live in the city where they rightly belong.\nIf you can do without the few pastoral pleasures of the country, you will find the city can provide you with the best that life can offer. You never have to travel miles to see your friends. They invariably lie nearby and are always available for an informal chat or an evening's entertainment. Some of my acquaintances in the country come up to town once or twice a year to visit the theatre as a special treat. For them this is a major operation which involves considerable planning. As the play draws to its close, they wonder whether they will ever catch that last train home. The cit dweller never experiences anxieties of this sort. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. The latest exhibitions, films, or plays are only a short bus ride away. Shopping, too, is always a pleasure. There is so much variety that you never have to make do with second best. Country people run wild when they go shopping in the city and stagger home loaded with as many of the exotic items as they can carry. Nor is the city without its moments of beauty. There is something comforting about the warm glow shed by advertisements on cold wet winter nights. Few things could be more impressive than the peace that descends on deserted city streets at weekends when the thousands that travel to work every day are tucked away in their homes in the country. It has always been a mystery to me who city dwellers, who appreciate all these things, obstinately pretend that they would prefer to live in the country.\n",

"text":"Cave exploration, or pot-holing, as it has come to be known, is a relatively new sport. Perhaps it is the desire for solitude or the chance of making an unexpected discovery that lures people down to the depths of the earth. It is impossible to give a satisfactory explanation for a pot-holer's motives. For him, caves have the same peculiar fascination which high mountains have for the climber. They arouse instincts which can only be dimly understood.\nExploring really deep caves is not a task for the Sunday afternoon rambler. Such undertakings require the precise planning and foresight of military operations. It can take as long as eight days to rig up rope ladders and to establish supply bases before a descent can be made into a very deep cave. Precautions of this sort are necessary, for it is impossible to foretell the exact nature of the difficulties which will confront the pot-holer. The deepest known cave in the world is the Gouffre Berger near Grenoble. It extends to a depth of 3,723 feet. This immense chasm has been formed by an underground stream which has tunneled a course through a flaw in the rocks. The entrance to the cave is on a plateau in the Dauphine Alps. As it is only six feet across, it is barely noticeable. The cave might never have been discovered has not the entrance been spotted by the distinguished French pot-holer, Berger. Since its discovery, it has become a sort of potholers' Everest. Though a number of descents have been made, much of it still remains to be explored.\nA team of pot-holers recently went down the Gouffre Berger. After entering the narrow gap on the plateau, they climbed down the steep sides of the cave until they came to narrow corridor. They had to edge their way along this, sometimes wading across shallow streams, or swimming across deep pools. Suddenly they came to a waterfall which dropped into an underground lake at the bottom of the cave. They plunged into the lake, and after loading their gear on an inflatable rubber dinghy, let the current carry them to the other side. To protect themselves from the icy water, they had to wear special rubber suits. At the far end of the lake, they came to huge piles of rubble which had been washed up by the water. In this part of the cave, they could hear an insistent booming sound which they found was caused by a small waterspout shooting down into a pool from the roof of the cave. Squeezing through a cleft in the rocks, the pot-holers arrived at an enormous cavern, the size of a huge concert hall. After switching on powerful arc lights, they saw great stalagmites -- some of them over forty feet high -- rising up like tree-trunks to meet the stalactites suspended from the roof. Round about, piles of limestone glistened in all the colours of the rainbow. In the eerie silence of the cavern, the only sound that could be heard was made by water which dripped continuously from the high dome above them.\n",

"text":"Insurance companies are normally willing to insure anything. Insuring public or private property is a standard practice in most countries in the world. If, however, you were holding an open air garden party or a fete it would be equally possible to insure yourself in the event of bad weather. Needless to say, the bigger the risk an insurance company takes, the higher the premium you will have to pay. It is not uncommon to hear that a shipping company has made a claim for cost of salvaging a sunken ship. But the claim made by a local authority to recover the cost of salvaging a sunken pie dish must surely be unique.\nAdmittedly it was an unusual pie dish, for it was eighteen feet long and six feet wide. It had been purchased by a local authority so that an enormous pie could be baked for an annual fair. The pie committee decided that the best way to transport the dish would be by canal, so they insured it for the trip. Shortly after it was launched, the pie committee went to a local inn to celebrate. At the same time, a number of teenagers climbed on to the dish and held a little party of their own. Dancing proved to be more than the dish could bear, for during the party it capsized and sank in seven feet of water.\nThe pie committee telephoned a local garage owner who arrived in a recovery truck to salvage the pie dish. Shivering in their wet clothes, the teenagers looked on while three men dived repeatedly into the water to locate the dish. They had little difficulty in finding it, but hauling it out of the water proved to be a serious problem. The sides of the dish were so smooth that it was almost impossible to attach hawsers and chains to the rim without damaging it. Eventually chains were fixed to one end of the dish and a powerful winch was put into operation. The dish rose to the surface and was gently drawn towards the canal bank. For one agonizing moment, the dish was perched precariously on the bank of the canal, but it suddenly overbalanced and slid back into the water. The men were now obliged to try once more. This time they fixed heavy metal clamps to both sides of the dish so that they could fasten the chains. The dish now had to be lifted vertically because one edge was resting against the side of the canal. The winch was again put into operation and one of the men started up the truck. Several minutes later, the dish was again put into operation and one of the water. Water streamed in torrents over its sides with such force that it set up a huge wave in the canal. There was danger that the wave would rebound off the other side of the bank and send the dish plunging into the water again. By working at tremendous speed, the men managed to get the dish on to dry land before the wave returned.\n",

"text":"People travelling long distances frequently have to decide whether they would prefer to go by land, sea, or air. Hardly anyone can positively enjoy sitting in a train for more than a few hours. Train compartments soon get cramped and stuffy. It is almost impossible to take your mind off the journey. Reading is only a partial solution, for the monotonous rhythm of the wheels clicking on the rails soon lulls you to sleep. During the day, sleep comes in snatches. At night, when you really wish to go to sleep, you rarely manage to do so. If you are lucky enough to get a sleeper, you spend half the night staring at the small blue light in the ceiling, or fumbling to find you ticket for inspection. Inevitably you arrive at your destination almost exhausted. Long car journeys are even less pleasant, for it is quite impossible even to read. On motorways you can, at least, travel fairly safely at high speeds, but more often than not, the greater part of the journey is spent on roads with few service stations and too much traffic. By comparison, ferry trips or cruises offer a great variety of civilized comforts. You can stretch your legs on the spacious decks, play games, meet interesting people and enjoy good food -- always assuming, of course, that the sea is calm. If it is not, and you are likely to get seasick, no form of transport could be worse. Even if you travel in ideal weather, sea journeys take a long time. Relatively few people are prepared to sacrifice holiday time for the pleasure of travlling by sea.\nAeroplanes have the reputation of being dangerous and even hardened travellers are intimidated by them. They also have the disadvantage of being an expensive form of transport. But nothing can match them for speed and comfort. Travelling at a height of 30,000 feet, far above the clouds, and at over 500 miles an hour is an exhilarating experience. You do not have to devise ways of taking your mind off the journey, for an aeroplane gets you to your destination rapidly. For a few hours, you settle back in a deep armchair to enjoy the flight. The real escapist can watch a film and sip champagne on some services. But even when such refinements are not available, there is plenty to keep you occupied. An aeroplane offers you an unusual and breathtaking view of the world. You soar effortlessly over high mountains and deep valleys. You really see the shape of the land. If the landscape is hidden from view, you can enjoy the extraordinary sight of unbroken cloud plains that stretch out for miles before you, while the sun shines brilliantly in a clear sky. The journey is so smooth that there is nothing to prevent you from reading or sleeping. However you decide to spend your time, one thing is certain: you will arrive at your destination fresh and uncrumpled. You will not have to spend the next few days recovering from a long and arduous journey.\n",

"text":"In democratic countries any efforts to restrict the freedom of the press are rightly condemned. However, this freedom can easily be abused. Stories about people often attract far more public attention than political events. Though we may enjoy reading about the lives of others, it is extremely doubtful whether we would equally enjoy reading about ourselves. Acting on the contention that facts are sacred, reporters can cause untold suffering to individuals by publishing details about their private lives. Newspapers exert such tremendous influence that they can not only bring about major changes to the lives of ordinary people but can even overthrow a government.\nThe story of a poor family that acquired fame and fortune overnight, dramatically illustrates the power of the press. The family lived in Aberdeen, a small town of 23,000 inhabitants in South Dakota. As the parents had five children, life was a perpetual struggle against poverty. They were expecting their sixth child and were faced with even more pressing economic problems. If they had only had one more child, the fact would have passed unnoticed. They would have continued to struggle against economic odds and would have lived in obscurity. But they suddenly became the parents of quintuplets, an aeroplane arrived in Aberdeen bringing sixty reporters and photographers.\nThe rise to fame was swift. Television cameras and newspapers carried the news to everyone in the country. Newspapers and magazines offered the family huge sums for the exclusive rights to publish stories and photographs. Gifts poured in not only from unknown people, but room baby food and soap manufacturers who wished to advertise their products. The old farmhouse the family lived in was to be replaced by new $500,000 home. Reporters kept pressing for interviews so lawyers had to be employed to act as spokesmen for the family at press conferences. While the five babies were babies were still quietly sleeping in oxygen tents in hospital nursery, their parents were paying the price for fame. It would never again be possible for them to lead normal lives. They had become the victims of commercialization, for their names had acquired a market value. Instead of being five new family members, these children had immediately become a commodity.\n",

No one can plead ignorance of a subject any longer, for these are countless do-it-yourself publications. Armed with the right tools and materials, newlyweds gaily embark on the task of decorating their own homes. Men, particularly, spend hours of their leisure time installing their own fireplaces, laying out their own gardens; building garages and making furniture. Some really keen enthusiasts go so far as to build their own computers. Shops cater for the do-it-yourself craze not only by running special advisory services for novices, but by offering consumers bits and pieces which they can assemble at home. Such things provide an excellent outlet for pent up creative energy, but unfortunately not all of us are born handymen.\nSome wives tend to believe that their husbands are infinitely resourceful and can fix anything. Even men who can hardly drive a nail in straight are supposed to be born electricians, carpenters, plumbers and mechanics. When lights fuse, furniture gets rickety, pipes get clogged, or vacuum cleaners fail to operate, some woman assume that their husbands will somehow put things right. The worst thing about the do-it-yourself game is that sometimes even men live under the delusion that they can do anything, even when they have repeatedly been proved wrong. It is a question of pride as much as anything else.\nLast spring my wife suggested that I call in a man to look at our lawn mower. It had broken down the previous summer, and though I promised to repair it, I had never got round to it. I would not hear of the suggestion and said that I would fix it myself. One Saturday afternoon, I hauled the machine into the garden and had a close look at it. As far as I could see, it needed only a minor adjustment: a turn of a screw here, a little tightening up there, a drop of oil and it would be as good as new. Inevitably the repair job was not quite so simple. The mower firmly refused to mow, so I decided to dismantle it. The garden was soon littered with chunks of metal which had once made up a lawn mower. But I was extremely pleased with myself. I had traced the cause of the trouble. One of links in the chain that drives the wheels had snapped. After buying a new chain I was faced with the insurmountable task of putting the confusing jigsaw puzzle together again. I was not surprised to find that the machine still refused to work after I had reassembled it, for the simple reason that I was left with several curiously shaped bits of metal which did not seem to fit anywhere. I gave up in despair. The weeks passed and the grass grew. When my wife nagged me to do something about it, I told her that either I would have to buy a new mower or let the grass grow. Needless to say our house is now surrounded by a jungle. Buried somewhere in deep grass there is a rusting lawn mower which I have promised to repair one day.\n",

There is only enough spring water to supply the needs of the houses, so we have to pump from the river for farm use. We tell river all our secrets. We know instinctively, just as beekeepers with their bees, that misfortune might overtake us if the important events of our lives were not related to it.\nWe have special river birthday parties in the summer. Sometimes were go upstream to a favourite backwater, sometimes we have our party at the boathouse, which a predecessor of ours at the farm built in the meadow hard by the deepest pool for swimming and diving. In a heat wave we choose a midnight birthday party and that is the most exciting of all. We welcome the seasons by the riverside, crowning the youngest girl with flowers in the spring, holding a summer festival on Midsummer Eve, giving thanks for the harvest in the autumn, and throwing a holy wreath into the current in the winter.\nAfter a long period of rain the river may overflow its banks. This is a rare occurrence as our climate seldom guest to extremes. We are lucky in that only the lower fields, which make up a very small proportion of our farm, are effected by flooding, but other farms are less favorably sited, and flooding can sometimes spell disaster for their owners.\nOne had winter we watched the river creep up the lower meadows. All the cattle had been moved into stalls and we stood to lose little. We were, however, worried about our nearest neighbors, whose farm was low lying and who were newcomers to the district. As the floods had put the telephone out of order, we could not find out how they were managing. From an attic window we could get a sweeping view of the river where their land joined ours, and at the most critical juncture we took turns in watching that point. The first sign of disaster was a dead sheep floating down. Next came a horse, swimming bravely, but we were afraid that the strength of the current would prevent its landing anywhere before it became exhausted. Suddenly a raft appeared, looking rather like Noah's ark, carrying the whole family, a few hens, the dogs, cat, and bird in a cage. We realized that they must have become unduly frightened by the rising flood, for their house, which had sound foundations, would have stood stoutly even if it had been almost submerged. The men of our family waded down through our flooded meadows with boathooks, in the hope of being able to grapple a corner of the raft and pull it out of the current towards our bank. We still think it a miracle that they we able to do so.\n",

But people who are cut off not only from foreign tourists, but even from their own countrymen can be hostile to travellers. Visits to really remote villages are seldom enjoyable -- as my wife and I discovered during a tour through the Balkans.\nWe had spent several days in a small town and visited a number of old churches in the vicinity. These attracted many visitors, for they were not only of great architectural interest, but contained a large number of beautifully preserved frescoes as well. On the day before our departure, several bus loads of tourists descended on the town. This was more than we could bear, so we decided to spend our last day exploring the countryside. Taking a path which led out of the town, we crossed a few fields until we came to a dense wood. We expected the path to end abruptly, but we found that it traced its way through the trees. We tramped through the wood for over two hours until we arrived at a deep stream. We could see that the path continued on the other side, but we had no idea how we could get across the stream. Suddenly my wife spotted a boat moored to the bank. In it there was a boatman fast asleep. We gently woke him up and asked him to ferry us to the other side. Though he was reluctant to do so at first, we eventually persuaded him to take us.\nThe path led to a tiny village perched on the steep sides of a mountain. The place consisted of a straggling unmade road which was lined on either side by small houses. Even under a clear blue sky, the village looked forbidding, as all the houses were built of grey mud bricks. The village seemed deserted, the only sign of life being an ugly-looking black goat on a short length of rope tied to a tree in a field nearby. Sitting down on a dilapidated wooden fence near the field, we opened a couple of tins of sardines and had a picnic lunch. All at once, I noticed that my wife seemed to be filled with alarm. Looking up I saw that we were surrounded by children in rags who were looking at us silently as we ate. We offered them food and spoke to them kindly, but they remained motionless. I concluded that they were simply shy of strangers. When we later walked down the main street of the villager, we were followed by a silent procession of children. The village which had seemed deserted, immediately came to life. Faces appeared at windows. Men in shirt sleeves stood outside their houses and glared at us. Old women in black shawls peered at us from doorways. The most frightening thing of all was that not a sound could be heard. There was no doubt that we were unwelcome visitors. We needed no further warning. Turning back down the main street, we quickened our pace and made our way rapidly towards the stream where we hoped the boatman was waiting.\n",

Aunt Harriet lived in that leisurely age when servants were employed to do housework. She had a huge, rambling country house called 'The Gables'. She was sentimentally attached to this house, for even though it was far too big for her needs, she persisted in living there long after her husband's death. Before she grew old, Aunt Harriet used to entertain lavishly. I often visited The Gables when I was boy. No matter how many guests were present, the great house was always immaculate. The parquet floors shone like mirrors; highly polished silver was displayed in gleaming glass cabinets; even my uncle's huge collection of books was kept miraculously free from dust. Aunt Harriet presided over an invisible army of servants that continuously scrubbed, cleaned, and polished. She always referred to them as 'the shifting population', for they came and went with such frequency that I never even got a chance to learn their names. Though my aunt pursued what was, in those days, an enlightened policy, in that she never allowed her domestic staff to work more than eight hours a day, she was extremely difficult to please. While she always criticized the fickleness of human nature, she carried on an unrelenting search for the ideal servant to the end of her days, even after she had been sadly disillusioned by Bessie.\nBessie worked for Aunt Harriet for three years. During that time she so gained my aunt's confidence that she was put in charge of the domestic staff. Aunt Harriet could not find words to praise Bessie's industriousness and efficiency. In addition to all her other qualifications, Bessie was an expert cook. She acted the role of the perfect servant for three years before Aunt Harriet discovered her 'little weakness'. After being absent from the Gables for a week, my aunt unexpectedly returned one afternoon with a party of guests and instructed Bessie to prepare dinner. No only was the meal well below the usual standard, but Bessie seemed unable to walk steadily. She bumped into the furniture and kept mumbling about the guests. When she came in with the last course -- a huge pudding -- she tripped on the carpet and the pudding went flying through the air, narrowly missed my aunt, and crashed on the dining table with considerable force. Though this caused great mirth among the guests, Aunt Harriet was horrified. She reluctantly came to the conclusion that Bessie was drunk. The guests had, of course, realized this from the moment Bessie opened the door for them and, long before the final catastrophe, had had a difficult time trying to conceal their amusement. The poor girl was dismissed instantly. After her departure, Aunt Harriet discovered that there were piles of empty wine bottles of all shapes and sizes neatly stacked in what had once been Bessie's wardrobe.

The same old favorites recur year in year out with monotonous regularity. We resolve to get up earlier each morning, eat less, find more time to play with the children, do a thousand and one jobs about the house, be nice to people we don't' like, drive carefully, and take the dog for a walk every day. Past experience has taught us that certain accomplishments are beyond attainment. If we remain inveterate smokers, it is only because we have so often experienced the frustration that results from failure. Most of us fail in our efforts at self-improvement because our schemes are too ambitious and we never have time to carry them out. We also make the fundamental error of announcing our resolutions to everybody so that we look even more foolish when we slip back into our bad old ways. Aware of these pitfalls, this year I attempted to keep my resolutions to myself. I limited myself to two modest ambitions: to do physical exercise every morning and to read more of an evening. An all-night party on New Year's Eve provided me with a good excuse for not carrying out either of these new resolutions on the first day of the year, but on the second, I applied myself assiduously to the task.\nThe daily exercises lasted only eleven minutes and I proposed to do them early in the morning before anyone had got up. The self-discipline required to drag myself out of bed eleven minutes earlier than usual was considerable. Nevertheless, I managed to creep down into the living room for two days before anyone found me out. After jumping about on the carpet and twisting the human frame into uncomfortable positions, I sat down at the breakfast table in an exhausted condition. It was this that betrayed me. The next morning the whole family trooped in to watch the performance. That was really unsettling, but I fended off the taunts and jibes of the family good-humouredly and soon everybody got used to the idea. However, my enthusiasm waned. The time I spent at exercises gradually diminished. Little by little the eleven minutes fell to zero. By January 10th, I was back to where I had started from. I argued that if I spent less time exhausting myself at exercises in the morning, I would keep my mind fresh for reading when I got home formwork Resisting the hypnotizing effect of television, I sat in my room for a few evenings with my eyes glued to book. One night, however, feeling cold and lonely, I went downstairs and sat in front of the television pretending to read. That proved to be my undoing, for I soon got back to my old bad habit of dozing off in front of the screen. I still haven't given up my resolution to do more reading. In fact, I have just bought a book entitled How to Read a Thousand Words a Minute. Perhaps it will solve my problem, but I just haven't had time to read it!\n",

"text":"Predicting the future is notoriously difficult. Who could have imagined, in the mid 1970s, for example, that by the end of the 20th century, computers would be as common in people's homes as TV sets? In the 1970s, computers were common enough, but only in big business, government departments, and large organizations. These were the so-called mainframe machines. Mainframe computers were very large indeed, often occupying whole air-conditioned rooms, employing full-time technicians and run on specially-written software. Though these large machines still exist, many of their functions have been taken over by small powerful personal computers, commonly known as PCs.\nIn 1975, a primitive machine called the Altair, was launched in the USA. It can properly be described as the first 'home computer' and it pointed the way to the future. This was followed, at the end of the 1970s, by a machine called an Apple. In the early 1980s, the computer giant, IBM produced the world's first Personal Computer. This ran on an 'operating system' called DOS, produced by a then small company named Microsoft. The IBM Personal Computer was widely copied. From those humble beginnings, we have seen the development of the user-friendly home computers and multimedia machines which are in common use today.\nConsidering how recent these developments are, it is even more remarkable that as long ago as the 1960s, an Englishman, Leon Bagrit, was able to predict some of the uses of computers which we know today. Bagrit dismissed the idea that computers would learn to 'think' for themselves and would 'rule the world', which people liked to believe in those days. Bagrit foresaw a time when computers would be small enough to hold in the hand, when they would be capable of providing information about traffic jams and suggesting alternative routes, when they would be used in hospitals to help doctors to diagnose illnesses, when they would relieve office workers and accountants of dull, repetitive clerical work. All these computer uses have become commonplace. Of course, Leon Bagrit could not possibly have foreseen the development of the Internet, the worldwide system that enables us to communicate instantly with anyone in any part of the world by using computers linked to telephone networks. Nor could he have foreseen how we could use the Internet to obtain information on every known subject, so we can read it on a screen in our homes and even print it as well if we want to. Computers have become smaller and smaller, more and more powerful and cheaper and cheaper. This is what makes Leon Bagrit's predictions particularly remarkable. If he, or someone like him, were alive today, he might be able to tell us what to expect in the next fifty years.\n",

If you were to ask Harry what was in the bottle, he would tell you that it contained perfumed mud. If you expressed doubt or surprise, he would immediately invite you to smell it and then to rub some into your skin. This brief experiment would dispel any further doubts you might have. The bottle really does contain perfumed mud. How Harry came into the possession of this outlandish stuff makes an interesting story which he is fond of relating. Furthermore, the acquisition of this bottle cured him of a bad habit he had been developing for years.\nHarry used to consider it a great joke to go into expensive cosmetic shops and make outrageous requests for goods that do not exist. He would invent fanciful names on the spot. On entering a shop, he would ask for a new perfume called 'Scented Shadow' or for 'insoluble bath cubes'. If a shop assistant told him she had not heard of it, he would pretend to be considerably put out. He loved to be told that one of his imaginary products was temporarily out of stock and he would faithfully promise to call again at some future date, but of course he never did. How Harry managed to keep a straight face during these performances is quite beyond me.\nHarry does not need to be prompted to explain how he bought his precious bottle of mud. One day, he went to an exclusive shop in London and asked for 'Myrolite', the shop assistant looked puzzled and Harry repeated the word, slowly stressing each syllable. When the woman shook her head in bewilderment, Harry went on to explain that 'myrolite' was a hard, amber-like substance which could be used to remove freckles. This explanation evidently conveyed something to the woman who searched shelf after shelf. She produced all sorts of weird concoctions, but none of them met with Harry's requirements. When Harry put on his act of being mildly annoyed, the assistant promised to order some for him. Intoxicated by his success, Harry then asked for perfumed mud. He expected the assistant to look at him in blank astonishment. However, it was his turn to be surprised, for the woman's eyes immediately lit up and she fetched several bottles which she placed on the counter for Harry to inspect. For once, Harry had to admit defeat. He picked up what seemed to be the smallest bottle and discreetly asked the price. He was glad to get away with a mere twenty pounds and he beat a hasty retreat, clutching the precious bottle under his arm. From then on, Harry decided that this little game he had invented might prove to be expensive. The curious bottle, which now adorns the bookcase in his study, was his first and last purchase of rare cosmetics.\n",

"text":"The Scandinavian countries are much admired all over the world for their enlightened social policies. Sweden has evolved an excellent system for protecting the individual citizen from highhanded or incompetent public officers. The system has worked so well, that it has been adopted in other countries too.\nThe Swedes were the first to recognize that public official like civil servants, police officers, health inspectors or tax-collectors can make mistakes or act over-zealously in the belief that they are serving the public. As long ago as 1809, the Swedish Parliament introduced a scheme to safeguard the interest of the individual. A parliamentary committee representing all political parties appoints a person who is suitably qualified to investigate private grievances against the State. The official title of the person is 'Justiteombudsman', but the Swedes commonly refer to him as the 'J.O.' or 'Ombudsman'. The Ombudsman is not subject to political pressure. He investigates complaints large and small that come to him from all levels of society. As complaints must be made in writing, the Ombudsman receives an average of 1,200 letters a year. He has eight lawyer assistants to help him and examines every single letter in detail. There is nothing secretive about the Ombudsman's work for his correspondence is open to public inspection. If a citizen's complaint is justified, the Ombudsman will act on his behalf. The action he takes varies according to the nature of the complaint. He may gently reprimand an official or even suggest to parliament that a law the altered. The following case is a typical example of the Ombudsman's work.\nA foreigner living in a Swedish village wrote to the Ombudsman complaining that he had been ill-treated by the police, simply because he was a foreigner. The Ombudsman immediately wrote to the Chief of Police in the district asking him to send a record of the case. There was nothing in the record to show that the foreigner's complaint was justified and the Chief of Police strongly denied the accusation. It was impossible for the Ombudsman to take action, but when he received a similar complaint from another foreigner in the same village, he immediately sent one of his layers to investigate the matter. The lawyer ascertained that a policeman had indeed dealt roughly with foreigners on several occasions. The fact that the policeman was prejudiced against foreigners could not be recorded in the official files. It was only possible for the Ombudsman to find this out by sending one of his representatives to check the facts. The policeman in question was severely reprimanded and was informed that if any further complaints were lodged against him, he would prosecuted. The Ombudsman's prompt action at once put an end to an unpleasant practice which might have gone unnoticed.\n",

We continually wage war on them, for they contaminate our food, carry diseases, or devour our crops. They sting or bite without provocation; they fly uninvited into our rooms on summer nights, or beat ageist our lighted windows. We live in dread not only of unpleasant insects like spiders or wasps, but of quite harmless one like moths. Reading about them increases our understanding without dispelling our fears. Knowing that the industrious ant lives in a highly organized society does nothing to prevent us from being filled with revulsion when we find hordes of them crawling over a carefully prepared picnic lunch. No matter how much we like honey, or how much we have read about the uncanny sense of direction which bees possess, we have a horror of being stung. Most of our fears are unreasonable, but they are impossible to erase. At the same time, however, insects are strangely fascinating. We enjoy reading about them, especially when we find that, like the praying mantis, they lead perfectly horrible lives. We enjoy staring at them, entranced as they go about their business, unaware (we hope) of our presence. Who has not stood in awe at the sight of a spider pouncing on a fly, or a column of ants triumphantly bearing home an enormous dead beetle?\nLast summer I spent days in the garden watching thousands of ants crawling up the trunk of my prize peach tree. The tree has grown against a warm wall on a sheltered side of the house. I am especially proud of it, not only because it has survived several severe winters, but because it occasionally produces luscious peaches. During the summer, I noticed tat the leaves of the tree were beginning to wither. Clusters of tin insects called aphids were to be found on the underside of the leaves. They were visited by a large colony of ants which obtained a sort of honey from them. I immediately embarked on an experiment which, even though if failed to get rid of the ants, kept me fascinated for twenty-four hours. I bound the base of the tree with sticky tape, making it impossible for the ants to reach the aphids. The tape was so stick that they did not dare to cross it. For a long time. I watched them scurrying around the base of the tree in bewilderment. I even went out at midnight with a torch and noted with satisfaction (and surprise) that the ants were still swarming around the sticky tape without being able to do anything about it. I got up early next morning hoping to find that the ants had given up in despair. Instead, I saw that they had discovered a new route. They were climbing up the wall of the house and then on to the leaves of the tree. I realized sadly that I had been completely defeated by their ingenuity. The ants had been quick to find an answer to my thoroughly unscientific methods!\n",

"text":"Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our won Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because, in relative terms, planets are very small and old not emit light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove infinitely more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our won solar system, for example, Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions, and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve.\nWhether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its 'sun'. Imagine a star up t twenty times larger, brighter, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. Alternatively, if the star were small, the life-supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we find such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life. The development of such a telescope will be one of the great astronomical projects of the twenty-first century.\nIt is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth-based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth, like the very successful Hubble telescope, would not be suitable because of the dust particles iron solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space, because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet, we would have to find a way of blotting out the light from its star, so that we would be able to 'see' the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life, rather than 'little green men'. The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers, we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope is always in the realms of science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet, it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed, 'Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human endeavor or thought would be unchanged by it.'\n",

I was only five when my father had taken me abroad, and that we eighteen years ago. When my mother had died after a tragic accident, he did not quickly recover from the shock and loneliness. Everything around him was full of her presence, continually reopening the wound. So he decided to emigrate. In the new country he became absorbed in making a new life for the two of us, so that he gradually ceased to grieve. He did not marry again and I was brought up without a woman's care; but I lacked for nothing, for he was both father and mother to me. He always meant to go back on day, but not to stay. His roots and mine bad become too firmly embedded in the new land. But he wanted to see the old folk again and to visit my mother's grave. He became mortally ill a few months before we had planned to go and, when he knew that he was dying, he made me promise to go on my own.\nI hired a car the day after landing and bought a comprehensive book of maps, which I found most helpful on the cross-country journey, but which I did not think I should need on the last stage. It was not that I actually remembered anything at all. But my father had described over and over again what we should see at every milestone, after leaving the nearest town, so that I was positive I should recognize it as familiar territory. Well, I had been wrong, for I was now lost.\nI looked at the map and then at the millimeter. I had come ten miles since leaving the town, and at this point, according to my father, I should be looking at farms and cottages in a valley, with the spire of the church of our village showing in the far distance. I could see no valley, no farms, no cottages and no church spire -- only a lake. I decided that I must have taken a wrong turning somewhere. So I drove back to the town and began to retrace the route, taking frequent glances at the map. I landed up at the same corner. The curious thing was that the lake was not marked on the map. I left as if I had stumbled into a nightmare country, as you sometimes do in dreams. And, as in a nightmare, there was nobody in sight to help me. Fortunately for me, as I was wondering what to do next, there appeared on the horizon a man on horseback, riding in my direction. I waited till he came near, then I asked him the way to our old village. He said that there was now no village. I thought he must have misunderstood me, so I repeated its name. This time he pointed to the lake. The village no longer existed because it had been submerged, and all the valley too. The lake was not a natural one, but a man-made reservoir.\n",

In the life her thoughts were on lunch and a good rest; but when she got out at her own floor, both were forgotten in her sudden discovery that her front door was open. She was thinking that she must reprimand her home help the next morning for such a monstrous piece of negligence, when she remembered that she had gone shopping after the home help had left and she knew that she had turned both keys in their locks, She walked slowly into the hall and at once noticed that all the room doors were open, yet following her regular practice she had shut them before going out. Looking into the drawing room, she saw a scene of confusion over by her writing desk. It was as clear as daylight then that burglars had forced an entry during her absence. Her first impulse was to go round all the rooms looking for the thieves, but then she decided that at her age it might be more prudent to have someone with her, so she went to fetch the porter from his basement. By this time her legs were beginning to tremble, so she sat down and accepted a cup of very strong tea, while he telephoned the police. Then, her composure regained, she was ready to set off with the porter's assistance to search for nay intruders who might still be lurking in her flat.\nThey went through the rooms, being careful to touch nothing, as they did not want to hinder the police in their search for fingerprints. The chaos was inconceivable. She had lived in the flat for thirty years and was a veritable magpie at hoarding; and it seemed as though everything she possessed had been tossed out and turned over and over. At least sorting out the things she should have discarded years ago was now being made easier for her. Then a police inspector arrived with a constable and she told them of her discovery of the ransacked flat. The inspector began to look for fingerprints, while the constable checked that the front door locks had not been forced, thereby proving that the burglars had either used skeleton keys or entered over the balcony. There was no trace of fingerprints, but the inspector found a dirty red bundle that contained jewellery which the old lady said was not hers. So their entry into this flat was apparently not the burglars' first job that day and they must have been disturbed. The inspector then asked the old lady to try to check what was missing by the next day and advised her not to stay alone in the flat for a few nights. The old lady though the was a fussy creature, but since the porter agreed with him, she rang up her daughter and asked for her help in what she described as a little spot of bother.\n",

"text":"People tend to amass possessions, sometimes without being aware of doing so. Indeed they can have a delightful surprise when they find something useful which they did not know they owned. Those who never have to move house become indiscriminate collectors of what can only be described as clutter. They leave unwanted objects in drawers, cupboards and attics for years, in the belief that they may one day need just those very things. As they grow old, people also accumulate belongings for two other reasons, lack of physical and mental energy, both of which are essential in turning out and throwing away, and sentiment. Things owned for a long time are full associations with the past, perhaps with relatives who are dead, and so they gradually acquire a value beyond their true worth.\nSome things are collected deliberately in the home in an attempt to avoid waste. Among these I would list string and brown paper, kept by thrifty people when a parcel has been opened, to save buying these two requisites. Collecting small items can easily become a mania. I know someone who always cuts sketches out from newspapers of model clothes that she would like to buy if she had the money. As she is not rich, the chances that she will ever be able to afford such purchases are remote; but she is never sufficiently strong-minded to be able to stop the practice. It is a harmless bait, but it litters up her desk to such an extent that every time she opens it, loose bits of paper fall out in every direction.\nCollecting as a serous hobby is quite different and has many advantages. It provides relaxation for leisure hours, as just looking at one's treasures is always a joy. One does not have to go outside for amusement, since the collection is housed at home. Whatever it consists of, stamps, records, first editions of books china, glass, antique furniture, pictures, model cars, stuffed birds, toy animals, there is always something to do in connection with it, from finding the right place for the latest addition, to verifying facts in reference books. This hobby educates one not only in the chosen subject, but also in general matters which have some bearing on it. There are also other benefits. One wants to meet like-minded collectors, to get advice, to compare notes, to exchange articles, to show off the latest find. So one's circle of friends grows. Soon the hobby leads to travel, perhaps to a meeting in another town, possibly a trip abroad in search of a rare specimen, for collectors are not confined to any one country. Over the years, one may well become a authority on one's hobby and will very probably be asked to give informal talks to little gatherings and then, if successful, to larger audiences. In this way self-confidence grows, first from mastering a subject, then from being able to take about it. Collecting, by occupying spare time so constructively, makes a person contented, with no time for boredom.\n",

Mr. Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new display. Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished. Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.\nThe silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade. It came to a stop outside the jeweller's. One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars. While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and tables went flying into the arcade. One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed. Just as it was leaving, Mr. Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.\n",

Only in a sparsely-populated rural community is it possible to disregard it. In ordinary living, there can be some tolerance of unpunctuality. The intellectual, who is working on some abstruse problem, has everything coordinated and organized for the matter in hand. He is therefore forgiven if late for a dinner party. But people are often reproached for unpunctuality when their only fault is cutting things fine. It is hard for energetic, quick-minded people to waste time, so they are often tempted to finish a job before setting out to keep an appointment. If no accidents occur on the way, like punctured tires, diversions of traffic, sudden descent of fog, they will be on time. They are often more industrious, useful citizens than those who are never late. The over-punctual can be as much a trial to others as the unpunctual. The guest who arrives half an hour too soon is the greatest nuisance. Some friends of my family had this irritating habit. The only thing to do was ask them to come half an hour later than the other guests. Then they arrived just when we wanted them.\nIf you are citing a train, it is always better to be comfortably early than even a fraction of a minted too late. Although being early may mean wasting a little time, this will be less than if you miss the train and have to wait an hour or more for the next one; and you avoid the frustration of arriving at the very moment when the train is drawing out of the station and being unable to get on it. An even harder situation is to be on the platform in good time for a train and still to see it go off without you. Such an experience befell a certain young girl the first time she was traveling alone.\nShe entered the station twenty minutes before the train was due, since her parents had impressed upon her that it would be unforgivable to miss it and cause the friends with whom she was going to stay to make two journeys to meet her. She gave her luggage to a porter and showed him her ticket. To her horror he said that she was two hours too soon. She felt inhere handbag for the piece of paper on which her father had written down al the details of the journey and gave it to the porter. He agreed that a train did come into the station at the time on the paper and that it did stop, but only to take on mail, not passengers. The girl asked to see a timetable, feeling sure that her father could not have made such a mistake. The porter went to fetch one and arrive back with the station master, who produced it with a flourish and pointed out a microscopic 'o' beside the time of the arrival of the train at his station; this little 'o' indicated that the train only stopped for mail. Just as that moment the train came into the station. The girl, tears streaming down her face, begged to be allowed to slip into the guard's van. But the station master was adamant: rules could not be broken and she had to watch that train disappear towards her destination while she was left behind.\n\n\n",

The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in eleventh century, lies about a mile away. For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times. Now that a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty. Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.\nDuring the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure. In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to -30° and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer of they have more privacy.

"text":"Cats never fail to fascinate human beings. They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well. They never become submissive like dogs and horses. As a result, humans have learned to respect feline independence. Most cats remain suspicious of humans all their lives. One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives. Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea. A cat's ability to survive falls is based on fact.\nRecently the New York Animal Medical Center made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months. All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries. Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings. There are plenty of high-rise windowsills to fall from! One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth. 'Cats behave like well-trained paratroopers.' a doctor said. It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves. In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more. At high speeds, falling cats have time to relax. They stretch out their legs like flying squirrels. This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.\n",

The only way that they can preserve their history is to recount it as sagas -- legends handed down from one generation of another. These legends are useful because they can tell us something about migrations of people who lived long ago, but none could write down what they did. Anthropologists wondered where the remote ancestors of the Polynesian peoples now living in the Pacific Islands came from. The sagas of these people explain that some of them came from Indonesia about 2,000 years ago.\nBut the first people who were like ourselves lived so long ago that even their sagas, if they had any, are forgotten. So archaeologists have neither history nor legends to help them to find out where the first 'modern men' came from.\nFortunately, however, ancient men made tools of stone, especially flint, because this is easier to shape than other kinds. They may also have used wood and skins, but these have rotted away. Stone does not decay, and so the tools of long ago have remained when even the bones of the men who made them have disappeared without trace.\nROBIN PLACE Finding fossil man\n",

As the time and cost of making a chip drop to a few days and a few hundred dollars, engineers may soon be free to let their imaginations soar without being penalized by expensive failures. Mead predicts that inventors will be able to perfect powerful customized chips over a weekend at the office -- spawning a new generation of garage start-ups and giving the U.S. a jump on its foreign rivals in getting new products to market fast. 'We're got more garages with smart people,' Mead observes. 'We really thrive on anarchy.'\nAnd on Asians. Already, orientals and Asian Americans constitute the majority of the engineering staffs at many Valley firms. And Chinese, Korean, Filipino and Indian engineers are graduating in droves from California's colleges. As the heads of next-generation start-ups, these Asian innovators can draw on customs and languages to forge righter links with crucial Pacific Rim markets. For instance, Alex Au, a Stanford Ph.

Young men who have reason to fear that they will be killed in battle may justifiably feel bitter in the thought that they have cheated of the best things that life has to offer. But in an old man who has known human joys and sorrows, and has achieved whatever work it was in him to do, the fear of death is somewhat abject and ignoble. The best way to overcome it -- so at least it seems to me -- is to make your interests gradually wider and more impersonal, until bit by bit the walls of the ego recede, and your life becomes increasingly merged in the universal life. An individual human existence should be like a river -- small at first, narrowly contained within its banks, and rushing passionately past boulders and over waterfalls. Gradually the river grows wider, the banks recede, the waters flow more quietly, and in the end, without any visible break, they become merged in the sea, and painlessly lose their individual being. The man who, in old age, can see his life in this way, will not suffer from the fear of death, since the things he cares for will continue. And if, with the decay of vitality, weariness increases, the thought of rest will be not unwelcome. I should wish to die while still at work, knowing that others will carry on what I can no longer do, and content in the thought that what was possible has been done.\nBERTRAND RUSSELL How to grow old from Portraits from Memory\n",

But, in addition to that basically simple concept, the bank and its customer owe a large number of obligations to one another. Many of these obligations can give in to problems and complications but a bank customer, unlike, say, a buyer of goods, cannot complain that the law is loaded against him.\nThe bank must obey its customer's instructions, and not those of anyone else. When, for example, a customer first opens an account, he instructs the bank to debit his account only in respect of cheques draw by himself. He gives the bank specimens of his signature, and there is a very firm rule that the bank has no right or authority to pay out a customer's money on a cheques on which its customer's signature has been forged. It makes no difference that the forgery may have been a very skilful one: the bank must recognize its customer's signature. For this reason there is no risk to the customer in the practice, adopted by banks, of printing the customer's name on his cheques. If this facilitates forgery, it is the bank which will lose, not the customer.\nGORDON BARRIE and AUBREY L. DLAMOND The Consumer Society and the Law\n",

When is has been decided where we are going to drill, we put up at the surface an oil derrick. It has to be tall because it is like a giant block and tackle, and we have to lower into the ground and haul out of the ground great lengths of drill pipe which are rotated by an engine at the top and are fitted with a cutting bit at the bottom.\nThe geologist needs to know what rocks the drill has reached, so every so often a sample is obtained with a coring bit. It cuts a clean cylinder of rock, from which can be seen the strata the drill has been cutting through. Once we get down to the oil, it usually flows to the surface because great pressure, either from or water, is pushing it. This pressure must be under control, and we control it by means of the mud which we circulate down the drill pipe. We endeavour to avoid the old, romantic idea of a gusher, which wastes oil and gas.

Errors and uncertainties multiply, cascading upward through a chain of turbulent features, from dust devils and squalls up to continent-size eddies that only satellites can see.\nThe modern weather models work with a grid of points of the order of sixty miles apart, and even so, some starting data has to guessed, since ground stations and satellites cannot see everywhere. But suppose the earth could be covered with sensors spaced one foot apart, rising at one-foot intervals all the way to the top of the atmosphere.

At noon the spaces between the sensors will hide fluctuations that the computer will not know about, tiny deviations from the average.

One is the general atmosphere of secrecy in which it is carried out, the other the lack of freedom of the individual research worker. In so far as any inquiry is a secret one, it naturally limits all those engaged in carrying it out from effective contact with their fellow scientists either in other countries or in universities, or even, often enough, in other departments of the same firm. The degree of secrecy naturally varies considerably. Some of the bigger firms are engaged in researches which are of such general and fundamental nature that it is a positive advantage to them not to keep them secret. Yet a great many processes depending on such research are sought for with complete secrecy until the stage at which patents can be taken out. Even more processes are never patented at all but kept as secret processes. This applies particularly to chemical industries, where chance discoveries play a much larger part than they do in physical and mechanical industries. Sometimes the secrecy goes to such an extent that the whole nature of the research cannot be mentioned. Many firms, for instance, have great difficulty in obtaining technical or scientific books from libraries because they are unwilling to have names entered as having taken out such and such a book, for fear the agents of other firms should be able to trace the kind of research they are likely to be undertaking.\nJ.D.

The great cities have been built with no regard for us. The shape and dimensions of the skyscrapers depend entirely on the necessity of obtaining the maximum income per square foot of ground, and of offering to the tenants offices and apartments that please them. This caused the construction of gigantic buildings where too large masses of human beings are crowded together. Civilized men like such a way of living. While they enjoy the comfort and banal luxury of their dwelling, they do not realize that they are deprived of the necessities of life.

This rabbit had no natural enemies in the Antipodes, so that it multiplied with that promiscuous abandon characteristic of rabbits. It overran a whole continent. It caused devastation by burrowing and by devouring the herbage which might have maintained millions of sheep and cattle. Scientists discovered that this particular variety of rabbit (and apparently no other animal) was susceptible to a fatal virus disease, myxomatosis. By infecting animals and letting them loose in the burrows, local epidemics of this disease could be created. Later it was found that there was a type of mosquito which acted as the carrier of this disease and passed it on to the rabbits. So while the rest of the world was trying to get rid of mosquitoes, Australia was encouraging this one. It effectively spread the disease all over the continent and drastically reduced the rabbit population. It later became apparent that rabbits were developing a degree of resistance to this disease, so that the rabbit population was unlikely to be completely exterminated. There were hopes, however, that the problem of the rabbit would become manageable.\nIronically, Europe, which had bequeathed the rabbit as a pest to Australia, acquired this man-made disease as a pestilence. A French physician decided to get rid of the wild rabbits on his own estate and introduced myxomatosis. It did not, however, remain within the confines of his estate. It spread through France, Where wild rabbits are not generally regarded as a pest but as sport and a useful food supply, and it spread to Britain where wild rabbits are regarded as a pest but where domesticated rabbits, equally susceptible to the disease, are the basis of a profitable fur industry. The question became one of whether Man could control the disease he had invented.\nRITCHIE CALDER Science Makes Sense\n",

Marine Studio biologists have pointed out that, however intelligent they may be, it is probably a mistake to credit dolphins with any motive of lifesaving. On the occasions when they have pushed to shore an unconscious human being they have much more likely done it out of curiosity or for sport, as in riding the bow waves of a ship. In 1928 some porpoises were photographer working like beavers to push ashore a waterlogged mattress. If, as has been reported, they have protected humans from sharks, it may have been because curiosity attracted them and because the scent of a possible meal attracted the sharks. Porpoises and sharks are natural enemies. It is possible that upon such an occasion a battle ensued, with the sharks being driven away or killed.\nWhether it be bird, fish or beast, the porpoise is intrigued with anything that is alive. They are constantly after the turtles, who peacefully submit to all sorts of indignities. One young calf especially enjoyed raising a turtle to the surface with his snout and then shoving him across the tank like an aquaplane. Almost any day a young porpoise may be seen trying to turn a 300-pound sea turtle over by sticking his snout under the edge of his shell and pushing up for dear life. This is not easy, and may require two porpoises working together. In another game, as the turtle swims across the oceanarium, the first porpoise swoops down from above and butts his shell with his belly. This knocks the turtle down several feet. He no sooner recovers his equilibrium than the next porpoise comes along and hits him another crack. Eventually the turtle has been butted all the way down to the floor of the tank. He is now satisfied merely to try to stand up, but as soon as he does so a porpoise knocks him flat.

Speculations about is nature have been going on for literally thousands of years, and one odd finding that makes the problem puzzling is that it looks very much as if sleeping is not simply a matter of giving the body a rest. 'Rest', in terms of muscle relaxation and so on, can be achieved by a brief period lying, or even sitting down. The body's tissues are self-repairing and self-restoring to a degree, and function best when more or less continuously active. In fact a basic amount of movement occurs during sleep which is specifically concerned with preventing muscle inactivity.\nIf it is not a question of resting the body, then perhaps it is the brain that needs resting? This might be a plausible hypothesis were it not for two factors. First the electroencephalograph (which is simply a device for recording the electrical activity of the brain by attaching electrodes to the scalp) shows that while there is a change in the pattern of activity during sleep, there is no evidence that the total amount of activity is any less. The second factor is more interesting and more fundamental. Some years ago an American psychiatrist named William Dement published experiments dealing with the recording of eye-movements during sleep. He showed that the average individual's sleep cycle is punctuated with peculiar bursts of eye-movements, some drifting and slow, others jerky and rapid. People woken during these periods of eye-movements generally reported that they had been dreaming. When woken at other times they reported no dreams. If one group of people were disturbed from their eye-movement sleep for several nights on end, and another group were disturbed for an equal period of time but when they were no exhibiting eye-movements, the first group began to show some personality disorders while the others seemed more or less unaffected. The implications of all this were that it was not the disturbance of sleep that mattered, but the disturbance of dreaming.\nCHRISTOPHER EVANS The stuff of dreams from The Listener\n",

Poison to a snake is merely a luxury; it enables it to get its food with very little effort, no more effort than one bite. And why only snakes? Cats, for instance, would be greatly helped; no running fights with large, fierce rats or tussles with grown rabbits -- just a bite and no more effort needed. In fact, it would be an assistance to all carnivores though it would be a two-edged weapon when they fought each other. But, of the vertebrates, unpredictable Nature selected only snakes (and one lizard). One wonders saliva into why Nature, with respect from that of others, as other on the blood.\nIn the conversion of saliva into poison, one might suppose that a fixed process took place. It did not; some snakes manufacture a poison different in every respect from that of others, as different as arsenic is from strychnine, and having different effects. One poison acts on the nerves, the other on the blood.\nThe makers of the nerve poison include the mambas and the cobras and their venom is called neurotoxic. Vipers (adders) and rattlesnakes manufacture the blood poison, which is known as haemolytic. Both poisons are unpleasant, but by far the more unpleasant is the blood poison. It is said that the nerve poison is the more primitive of the two, that the blood poison is, so to speak, a newer product from an improved formula. Be that as it may, the nerve poison does its business with man far more quickly than the blood poison. This, however, means nothing.

He had lived in it as a child when it was already disappearing, and his hero was firmly rooted in his memories and experiences, and in both the history and the mythology of the vanished frontier. And although no period or place in American history has been more absurdly romanticized, myth and reality did join hands in at least one arena, the conflict between the individual and encroaching civilization.\nMen accustomed to struggling for survival against the elements and Indians were bewildered by politicians, bankers and businessmen, and unhorsed by fences, laws and alien taboos. Hart's good-bad man was always an outsider, always one of the disinherited, and if he found it necessary to shoot a sheriff or rob a bank along the way, his early audiences found it easy to understand and forgive, especially when it was Hart who, in the end, overcame the attacking Indians.\nAudiences in the second decade of the twentieth century found it pleasant to escape to a time when life, though hard, was relatively simple.

With the invention of writing, a great advance was made, for knowledge could then be not only communicated but also stored. Libraries made education possible, and education in its turn added to libraries: the growth of knowledge followed a kind of compound interest law, which was greatly enhanced by the invention of printing. All this was comparatively slow until, with the coming of science, the tempo was suddenly raised. Then knowledge began to be accumulated according to a systematic plan. The trickle became a stream; the stream has now become a torrent. Moreover, as soon as new knowledge is acquired, it is now turned to practical account. What is called 'modern civilization' is not the result of a balanced development of all man's nature. but of accumulated knowledge applied to practical life. The problem now facing humanity is: What is going to be done with all this knowledge? As is so often pointed out, knowledge is a two-edged weapon which can be used equally for good or evil.

The albatross is the king of the gliders, the class of fliers which harness the air to their purpose, but must yield to its opposition. In the contrary school, the duck is supreme. It comes nearer to the engines with which man has 'conquered' the air, as he boasts. Duck, and like them the pigeons, are endowed with such-like muscles, that are a good part of the weight of the bird, and these will ply the short wings with such irresistible power that they can bore for long distances through an opposing gale before exhaustion follows. Their humbler followers, such as partridges, have a like power of strong propulsion, but soon tire. You may pick them up in utter exhaustion, if wind over the sea has driven them to a long journey. The swallow shares the virtues of both schools in highest measure. It tires not, nor does it boast of its power; but belongs to the air, travelling it may be six thousand miles to and from its northern nesting home, feeding its flown young as it flies, and slipping through we no longer take omens from their flight on this side and that; and even the most superstitious villagers no longer take off their hats to the magpie and wish it good-morning.\nWILLIAM BEACH THOMAS A Countryman's Creed\n",

It is difficult for any of us in moments of intense aesthetic experience to resist the suggestion that we are catching a glimpse of a light that shines down to us from a different realm of existence, different and, because the experience is intensely moving, in some way higher. And, though the gleams blind and dazzle, yet do they convey a hint of beauty and serenity greater than we have known or imagined. Greater too than we can describe; for language, which was invented to convey the meanings of this world, cannot readily be fitted to the uses of another.\nThat all great has this power of suggesting a world beyond is undeniable. In some moods, Nature shares it. There is no sky in June so blue that it does not point forward to a bluer, no sunset so beautiful that it does not waken the vision of a greater beauty, a vision which passes before it is fully glimpsed, and in passing leaves and indefinable longing and regret. But, if this world is not merely a bad joke, life a vulgar flare amid the cool radiance of the stars, and existence an empty laugh braying across the mysteries; if these intimations of a something behind and beyond are not evil humour born of indigestion, or whimsies sent by the devil to mock and madden us. if, in a word, beauty means something, yet we must not seek to interpret the meaning. If we glimpse the unutterable, it is unwise to try to utter it, nor should we seek to invest with significance that which we cannot grasp. Beauty in terms of our human meanings is meaningless.\nC.E.M.JOAD Pieces of Mind\n",

"text":"May people in industry and the Services, who have practical experience of noise, regard any investigation of this question as a waste of time; they are not prepared even to admit the possibility that noise affects people. On the other hand, those who dislike noise will sometimes use most inadequate evidence to support their pleas for a quieter society. This is a pity, because noise abatement really is a good cause, and it is likely to be discredited if it gets to be associated with had science.\nOne allegation often made is that noise produces mental illness. A recent article in a weekly newspaper, for instance, was headed with a striking illustration of a lady in a state of considerable distress, with the caption 'She was yet another victim, reduced to a screaming wreck'. On turning eagerly to the text, one learns that the lady was a typist who found the sound of office typewriters worried her more and more until eventually she had to go into a mental hospital. Now the snag in this sort of anecdote is of course that one merely a symptom? Another patient might equally well complain that her neighbours were combining to slander her and persecute her, and yet one might be cautious about believing this statement.\nWhat is needed in case of noise is a study of large numbers of people living under noisy conditions, to discover whether they are mentally ill more often than other people are. Some time ago the United States Navy, for instance, examined a very large number of men working on aircraft carriers: the study was known as Project Anehin. It can be unpleasant to live even several miles from an aerodrome; if you think what it must be like to share the deck of a ship with several squadrons of jet aircraft, you will realize that a modern navy is a good place to study noise. But neither psychiatric interviews nor objective tests were able to show any effects upon these American sailors. This result merely confirms earlier American and British studies: if there is any effect of noise upon mental health, it must be so small that present methods of psychiatric diagnosis cannot find it. That does not prove that it does exist: but it does mean that noise is less dangerous than, say, being brought up in an orphanage -- which really is mental health hazard.\nD.E.BROADBENT Non-auditory effects of noise from Science Survey\n",

After all, all living creatures live by feeding on something else, whether it be plant or animal, dead or alive, and it is only by chance that such a fate is avoided. The remains of plants and animals that lived on land are much more rarely preserved, for there is seldom anything to cover them over. When you think of the innumerable birds that one sees flying bout, not to mention the equally numerous small animals like field mice and voles which you do not see, it is very rarely that one comes across a dead body, except, of course, on the roads. They decompose and are quickly destroyed by the weather or eaten by some other creature.\nIt is almost always due to some very special circumstances that traces of land animals survive, as by falling into inaccessible caves, or into an ice crevasse, like the Siberian mammoths, when the whole animal is sometimes preserved, as in a refrigerator. This is what happened to the famous Beresovka mammoth which was found preserved and in good condition. In his mouth were the remains of fir trees -- the last meal that he had before he fell into the crevasse and broke his back. The mammoth has now just a suburb of Los Angeles. Apparently what happened was that water collected on these tar pits, and the bigger animals like the elephants ventured out on to the apparently firm surface to drink, and were promptly bogged in the tar. And then, when they were dead, the carnivores, like the sabre-toothed cats and the giant wolves, came out to feed and suffered exactly the same fate. There are also endless numbers of birds in the tar as well.\nERROL WHITE The past life of the earth from Discovery\n",

For nearly three and a half centuries she lay at the bottom of Stockholm harbour until her discovery in 1956. This was the Vasa, royal flagship of the great imperial fleet.\nKing Gustavus Adolphus, 'The Northern Hurricane', then at the height of his military success in the Thirty Years' War, had dictated her measurements and armament. Triple gun-decks mounted sixty-four bronze cannon. She was intended to play a leading role in the growing might of Sweden.\nAs she was prepared of her maiden voyage on August 10, 1628, Stockholm was in a ferment. From the Skeppsbron and surrounding islands the people watched this thing of beauty begin to spread her sails and catch the wind. They had laboured for three years to produce this floating work of art; she was more richly carved and ornamented than any previous ship. The high stern castle was a riot of carved gods, demons, knights, kings, warriors, mermaids, cherubs; and zoomorphic animal shapes ablaze with rea and gold and blue, symbols of courage, power, and cruelty, were portrayed to stir the imaginations of the superstitious sailors of the day.\nThen the cannons of the anchored warships thundered a salute to which the Vasa fired in reply. As the emerged from her drifting cloud of gun smoke with the water churned to foam beneath her bow, her flags colour, she presented a more majestic spectacle than Stockholmers had ever seen before. All gun-ports were open and the muzzles peeped wickedly from them.\nAs the wind freshened there came a sudden squall and the ship made a strange movement, listing to port. The Ordnance Officer ordered all the port cannon to be heaved to starboard to counteract the list, but the steepening angle of the decks increased. Then the sound of rumbling thunder reached the watchers on the shore, as cargo, ballast, ammunition and 400 people went sliding and crashing down to the port side of the steeply listing ship. The lower gun-ports were now below water and the inrush sealed the ship's fate. In that first glorious hour, the mighty Vasa, which was intended to rule the Baltic, sank with all flags flying-in the harbour of her birth.\nROY SAUNGERS The Raising of the 'Vasa' from The Listener\n",

This modern faith in medicines is proved the fact that the annual drug bill of the Health Services is mounting to astronomical figures and shows no signs at present of ceasing to rise. The majority of the patients attending the medical out-patients departments of our hospitals feel that they have not received adequate treatment unless they are able to carry home with them some tangible remedy in the shape of a bottle of medicine, a box of pills, or a small jar of ointment, and the doctor in charge of the department is only too ready to provide them with these requirements. There is no quicker method of disposing of patients then by giving them what they are asking for, and since most medical men in the Health Services are overworked and have little time for offering time-consuming and little-appreciated advice on such subjects as diet, right living, and the need for abandoning bad habits etc., the bottle, the box, and the jar are almost always granted them.\nNor is it only the ignorant and ill-educated person who was such faith in the bottle of medicine. It is recounted of Thomas Carlyle that when him in his pocket what remained of a bottle of medicine formerly prescribed for an indisposition of Mrs. Carlyle's. Carlyle was entirely ignorant of what the bottle in his pocket contained, of the nature of the illness from which his friend was suffering, and of what had previously been wrong with his wife, but a medicine that had worked so well in one form of illness would surely be of equal benefit in another, and comforted by the thought of the help he was bringing to his friend, he hastened to Henry Taylor's house. History does not relate whether his friend accepted his medical help, but in all probability he did. The great advantage of taking medicine is that it makes no demands on the taker beyond that of putting up for a moment with a disgusting taste, and that is what all patients demand of their doctors -- to be cured at no inconvenience to themselves.\n",

"text":"Many strange new means of transport have been developed in our century, the strangest of them being perhaps the hovercraft. In 1953, a former electronics engineer in his fifties, Christopher Cockerell, who had turned to boat-building on the Norfolk Broads, suggested an idea on which he had been working for many years to the British Government and industrial circles. It was the idea of supporting a craft on a 'pad', or cushion, of low-pressure air, ringed with a curtain of higher pressure air. Ever since, people have had difficulty in deciding whether the craft should be ranged among ships, planes, or land vehicles -- for it is something in between a boat and an aircraft. As a shipbuilder, Cockerell was trying to find a solution to the problem of the wave resistance which wastes a good deal of a surface ship's power and limits its speed. His answer was to lift the vessel out of the water by a great number of ring-shaped air jets on the bottom of the craft. It 'flies', therefore, but it cannot fly higher -- its action depends on the surface, water or ground, over which it rides.\nThe first tests on the Solent in 1959 caused a sensation. The hovercraft travelled first over the water, then mounted the beach, climbed up the dunes, and sat down on a road. Later it crossed the Channel, riding smoothly over the waves, which presented no problem.\nSince that time, various types of hovercraft have appeared and taken up regular service. The hovercraft is particularly useful in large areas with poor communications such as Africa or Australia; it can become a 'flying fruit-bowl', carrying bananas from the plantations to the ports; giant hovercraft liners could span the Atlantic; and the railway of the future may well be the 'hovertrain', riding on its air cushion over a single rail, which it never touches, at speeds up to 300 m.p.h. -- the possibilities appear unlimited.\nEGON LARSEN The Pegasus Book of Inventors\n",

It is true that during their explorations they often faced difficulties and dangers of the most perilous nature, equipped in a manner with would make a modern climber shudder at the thought, but they did not go out of their way to court such excitement. They had a single aim, a solitary goal -- the top!\nIt is hard for us to realize nowadays how difficult it was for the pioneers. Except for one or two places such as Zermatt and Chamonix, which had rapidly become popular, Alpine village tended to be impoverished settlements cut off from civilization by the high mountains. Such inns as there were generally dirty and flea-ridden; the food simply local cheese accompanied by bread often twelve months old, all washed down with coarse wine. Often a valley boasted no inn at all, and climbers found shelter wherever they could -- sometimes with the local priest (who was usually as poor as his parishioners), sometimes with shepherds or cheese-makers.

The open sea was deep and mysterious, and anyone who gave more than a passing thought to the bottom confines of the oceans probably assumed that the sea bad was flat. Sir James Clark Ross had obtained a sounding of over 2,400 fathoms in 1839, but it was not until of deep soundings was obtained in the Atlantic and the first samples were collected by dredging the bottom. Shortly after this the famous H. M. S. Challenger expedition established the study of the sea-floor as a subject worthy of the most qualified physicists and geologists. A burst of activity associated with the laying of submarine cables soon confirmed the challenger's observation that many parts of the ocean were two to there miles deep, and the existence of underwater features of considerable magnitude.\nToday, enough soundings are available to enable a relief map of the Atlantic to be drawn and we know something of the great variety of the sea bed's topography. Since the sea covers the greater part of the earth's surface, it is quite reasonable to regard the sea floor as the basic form of the crust of the earth, with, superimposed upon, it the continents, together with the islands and other features of the oceans. The continents form rugged tablelands which stand nearly three miles above the floor of the open ocean. From the shore line, out a distance which may be anywhere from a few miles to a few hundred miles, runs the gentle slope of the continental shelf, geologically part of the continents. The real dividing line between continents and oceans occurs at the foot a steeper slope.\nThis continental slope usually starts at a place somewhere near the 100-fatheom mark and in the course of a few hundred miles reaches the true ocean floor at 2,500-3,500 fathoms. The slope averages about 1 in 30. but contains steep, probably vertical, cliffs, and gentle sediment-covered terraces, and near its lower reaches there is a long tailing-off which is almost certainly the result of material transported out to deep water after being eroded from the continental masses.\nT.F.GASKELL Exploring the Sea-floor from Science Survey\n",

That is perhaps why sculpture has been described as the most difficult of all arts; certainly it is more difficult than the arts which involve appreciation of flat forms, shape in only two dimensions. Many more people are 'form-blind' than colour-blind. The child learning to see, first distinguishes only two-dimensional shape; it cannot judge distances, depths. Later, for its personal safety and practical needs, it has to develop (partly by means of touch) the ability to judge roughly three-dimensonal distances. But having satisfied the requirements of practical necessity, most people go no further. Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat from, they do no make the further. Though they may attain considerable accuracy in the perception of flat form, they do not make the further intellectual and emotional effort needed to comprehend form in its full spatial existence.\nThis is what the sculptor must do. He must strive continually to think of, and use, form in its full spatial completeness. He gets the solid shape, as it were, inside his head-he thinks of it, whatever its size, as if he were holding it completely enclosed in the hollow of his hand. He mentally visualizes a complex form from all round itself; he knows while he looks at one side what the other side is like, he identifies himself with its centre of gravity, its mass, its weight; he realizes its volume, as the space that the shape displaces in the air.\nAnd the sensitive observer of sculpture must also learn to feel shape simply as shape, not as description or reminiscence. He must, for example, perceive an egg as a simple single solid shape, quite apart from its significance as food, or from the literary idea that it will become a bird. And so with solids such as a shell, a nut, a plum, a pear, a tadpole, a mushroom, a mountain peak, a kidney, a carrot, a tree-trunk, a bird, a bud, a lark, a ladybird, a bulrush, a bone.

But, in contrast, it is only in modern times that Galileo has become a problem child for historians of science.\nThe old view of Galileo was delightfully uncomplicated. He was, above all, a man who experimented: who despised the prejudices and book learning of the Aristotelians, who put his questions to nature instead of to the ancients, and who drew his conclusions fearlessly. He had been the first to turn a telescope to the sky, and he had seen there evidence enough to overthrow Aristotle and Ptolemy together. He was the man who climbed the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropped various weights from the top, who rolled balls down inclined planes, and then generalized the results of his many experiments into the famous law of free fall.\nBut a closer study of the evidence, supported by a deeper sense of the period, and particularly by a new consciousness of the philosophical undercurrents in the scientific revolution, has profoundly modified this view of Galileo. Today, although the old Galileo lives on in many popular writings, among historians of science a new and more sophisticated picture has emerged. At the same time our sympathy fro Galileo's opponents ahs grown somewhat. His telescopic observations are justly immortal; they aroused great interest at the time, they had important theoretical consequences, and they provided a striking demonstration of the potentialities hidden in instruments and apparatus. But can we blame those who looked and failed to see what Galileo saw, if we remember that to use a telescope at the limit of its powers calls for long experience and intimate familiarity with one's instrument? Was the philosopher who refused to look through Galileo's telescope more culpable than those who alleged that the spiral nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's great telescope in the eighteen-forties were scratches left by the grinder? We can perhaps forgive those who said the moons of Jupiter were produced by Galileo's spyglass if we recall that in his day, as for centuries before, curved glass was the popular contrivance for producing not truth but illusion, untruth; and if a single curved glass would distort nature, how much more would a pair of them?\nMICHAEL HOSKIN Galileo Reborn from The Listener\n",

A man without an education, many of us believe, is an unfortunate victim of adverse circumstances, deprived of one of the greatest twentieth-century opportunities. Convinced of the importance of education, modern states 'invest' in institutions of learning to get back 'interest' in the form of a large group of enlightened young men and women who are potential leaders. Education, with its cycles of instruction so carefully worked out, punctuated by textbooks -- those purchasable wells of wisdom-what would civilization be like without its benefits?\nSo much is certain: that we would have doctors and preachers, lawyers and defendants, marriages and births -- but our spiritual outlook would be different. We would lay less stress on 'facts and figures' and more on a good memory, on applied psychology, and on the capacity of a man to get along with his fellow-citizens. If our educational system were fashioned after its bookless past we would have the most democratic form of 'college' imaginable. Among tribal people all knowledge inherited by tradition is shared by all; it is taught to every member of the tribe so that in this respect everybody is equally equipped for life.\nIt is the ideal condition of the 'equal start' which only our most progressive forms of modern education try to regain. In primitive cultures the obligation to seek and to receive the traditional instruction is binding to all. There are no 'illiterates' -- if the term can be applied to peoples without a script -- while our own compulsory school attendance became law in Germany in 1642, in France in 1806, and in England in 1876, and is still non-existent in a number of 'civilized' nations. This shows how long it was before we deemed it necessary to make sure that all our children could share in the knowledge accumulated by the 'happy few' during the past centuries.\nEducation in the wilderness is not a matter of monetary means. All are entitled to an equal start. There is none of the hurry which, in our society, often hampers the full development of a growing personality. There, a child grows up under the ever-present attention of his parent; therefore the jungles and the savannahs know of no 'juvenile delinquency'.

Such loss of dignity and descent into childish behaviour on the part to their parents about the place or people they visit. Before very long the parents will be complaining that the child is so secretive and never tells them anything, but they seldom realize that they have brought this on themselves.\nDisillusionment with the parents, however good and adequate they may be both as parents and as individuals, is to some degree inevitable. Most children have such a high ideal of their parents, unless the parents themselves have been unsatisfactory, that it can hardly hope to stand up to a realistic evaluation. Parents would be greatly surprised and deeply touched if they hope to stand up to a realistic evaluation. Parents would be greatly surprised and deeply touched if they realized how much belief their children usually have in their character and infallibility, and how much this faith means to a child. If parents were prepared for this adolescent reaction, and realized that it was a sign that the child was growing up and developing valuable powers of observation and independent judgment, they would not be so hurt, and therefore would not drive the child into opposition by resenting and resisting it.\nThe adolescent, with his passion for sincerity, always respects a parent who admits that he is wrong, or ignorant, or even that he has been unfair or unjust. What the child cannot forgive is the parent's refusal to admit these charges if the child knows them to be true.\nVictorian parents believed that they kept their dignity by retreating behind an unreasoning authoritarian attitude; in fact they did nothing of the kind, but children were then too cowed to let them know how they really felt. Today we tend to go to the other extreme, but on the whole this is a healthier attitude both for the child and the parent.

This increases the expense of government, and reduces correspondingly the amount of economic resources that could be used for developing the country. And it should not be forgotten how small those resources are in a poor and backward country. Where the cost of government is high, resources for development are correspondingly low.\nThis may be illustrated by comparing the position of a nation with that of a private business enterprise. An enterprise has to incur certain costs and expenses in order to stay in business. For our purposes, we are concerned only with one kind of cost -- the cost of managing and administering the business. Such administrative overheads in a business are analogous to the cost of government in a nation. The administrative overheads of a business are low to the extent that everyone working in the business can be trusted to behave in a way that best promotes the interests of the firm. If they can each be trusted to take such responsibilities. and to exercise such initiative as falls within their sphere, then administrative overheads will be low. It will be low because it will be necessary to have only one man looking after each job, then the business will require armies of administrators, checkers, and foremen and administrative overheads will rise correspondingly. As administrative overheads rise, so the earnings of the business after meeting he expense of administration, will fall; and the business will have less money to distribute as dividends or invest directly in its future progress and development.\nIt is precisely the same with a nation. To the extent that the people can be relied upon to behave in a loyal and responsible manner, the government does not require armies of police and civil servants to keep them in order. But if a nation is disunited, the government cannot be sure that the actions of the people will be in the interests of the nation; and it will have to watch, check, and control the people accordingly.

It has yet to reach its full size and strength, and its owner his or her full intelligence; but at this age the likelihood of death is least. Earlier, we were infants and young children, and consequently more vulnerable; later, we shall undergo a progressive loss of our vigour and resistance which, though imperceptible at first, will finally become so steep that we can live no longer, however well we look after ourselves, and however well society, and our doctors, look after us. This decline in vigour with the passing of time is called ageing. It is one of the most unpleasant discoveries which we all make that we must decline in this way, that if we escape wars, accidents and disease we shall eventually 'die of old age', and that this happens at a rate which differs little from person to person, so that there are heavy odds in favour of our dying between the ages of sixty-five and eighty. Some of us will die sooner, a few will live longer -- on into a ninth or tenth decade. But the chances are against it, and there is a virtual limit on how long we can hope to remain alive, however lucky and robust we are.\nNormal people tend to forget this process unless and until they are reminded of it. We are so familiar with the fact that man ages, that people have for years assumed that the process of losing vigour with time, of becoming more likely to die the older we get, was something self-evident, like the cooling of a hot kettle or the wearing-out of a pair of shoes. They have also assumed that all animals, and probably other organisms such as trees, or even the universe itself, must in the nature of things 'wear out'. Most animals we commonly observe do in fact age as we do, if given the chance to live long enough; and mechanical systems like a wound watch, or the sun, do in fact run out of energy in accordance with the second law of thermodynamics (whether the whole universe does so is a moot point at present). But these are not analogous to what happens when man ages. A run-down watch is still a watch and can be rewound. An old watch, by contrast, becomes so worn and unreliable that it eventually is not worth mending. But a watch could never repair itself -- it does not consist of living parts, only of metal, which wears away by friction. We could, at one time, repair ourselves --well enough, at least, to overcome all but the most instantly fatal illnesses and accidents. Between twelve and eighty years we gradually lose this power; an illness which at twelve would knock us over, at eighty can knock us out, and another 700 for the survivors to be reduced by half again.\nALEX COMFORT The process of ageing\n",

"text":"Contamination of water supplies is usually due to poor sanitation close to water sources, sewage disposal into the sources themselves, leakage of sewage into distribution systems or contamination with industrial or farm waste. Even if a piped water supply is safe at its source, it is not always safe by the time it reaches the tap. Intermittent tap-water supplies should be regarded as particularly suspect.\nTravellers on short trips to areas with water supplies of uncertain quality should avoid drinking tap-water, or untreated water from any other source. It is best to hot drinks, bottled or canned drinks of well-known brand names -- international standards of water treatment are usually followed at bottling plants. Carbonated drinks are acidic, and slightly safer. Make sure that all bottles are opened in your presence, and that their rims are clean and dry.\nBoiling is always a good way of treating water. Some hotels supply boiled water on request and this can be used for drinking, or for brushing teeth. Portable boiling elements that can boil small quantities of water are useful when the right voltage of electricity is available. Refuse politely any cold drink from an unknown source.\nIce is only as safe as the water from which it is made, and should not be put in drinks unless it is known to be safe. Drink can be cooled by placing them on ice tather than adding ice to them.\nAlcohol may be a medical disinfectant, but should not be relied upon to sterilize water. Ethanol is more effective at a concentration of 50-70 per cent; below 20 per cent, its bactericidal action is negligible. Spirits labelled 95 proof contain only about 47 per cent alcohol. Beware of methylated alcohol, which is very poisonous, and should never be added to drinking water.\nIf no other safe supply can be obtained, tap water that is too hot to touch can be left to cool and is generally safe to drink. Those planning a trip to remote areas, or intending to live in countries where drinking water is not readily available, should know about the various possible methods for making water safe.\nRICHARD DAWOOD Travellers' Health\n",

"text":"I have known very few writers, but those I have known, and whom I respect, confess at once that they have little idea where they the are going when they first set pen to paper. They have a character, perhaps two; they are in that condition of eager discomfort which passes for inspiration; all admit radical changes of destination once the journey has begun; one, to my certain knowledge, spent nine months on a novel about Kashmir, then reset the whole thing in the Scottish Highlands. I never heard of anyone making a 'skeleton', as we were taught at school. In the breaking and remaking, in the timing, interweaving, beginning afresh, the writer comes to discern things in his material which were not consciously in his mind when he began. This organic process, often leading to moments of extraordinary self-discovery, is of an indescribable fascination. A blurred image appears; he adds a brushstroke and another, and it is gone; but something was there, and he will not rest till he has captured it. Sometimes the yeast within a writer outlives a book he has written. I have heard of writers who read nothing but their own books; like adolescents they stand before the mirror, and still cannot fathom the exact outline of the vision before them. For the same reason, writers talk interminably about their own books, winkling out hidden meanings, super-imposing new ones, begging response from those around them. Of course a writer doing this is misunderstood: he might as well try to explain a crime or a love affair. He is also, incidentally, an unforgivable bore.\nThis temptation to cover the distance between himself and the reader, to study his image in the sight of those who do not know him, can be his undoing: he has begun to write to please.\nA young English writer made the pertinent observation a year or two back that the talent goes into the first draft, and the art into the drafts that follow. For this reason also the writer, like any other artist, has no resting place, no crowd or movement in which he may take comfort, no judgment from outside which can replace the judgment from within. A writer makes order out of the anarchy of his heart; he submits himself to a more ruthless discipline than any critic dreamed of, and when he flirts with fame, he is taking time off from living with himself, from the search for what his world contains at its inmost point.\nJOHN LE CARRE What every writer wants from Harper's\n",

"text":"Several cases have been reported in Russia recently of people who can detect colours with their fingers, and even see through solid and walls. One case concerns and eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Vera Petrova, who has normal vision but who can also perceive things with different parts of her skin, and through solid walls. This ability was first noticed by her father. One day she came into his office and happened to put her hands on the door of a locked safe. Suddenly she asked her father why he kept so many old newspapers locked away there, and even described the way they were done up in bundles.\nVera's curious talent was brought to the notice of a scientific research institute in the town of Ulyanovsk, near where she lives, and in April she was given a series of tests by a special commission of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federal Republic. During these tests she was able to read a newspaper through an opaque screen and, stranger still, by moving her elbow over a child's game of Lotto she was able to describe the figures and colours printed on it; and, in another instance, wearing stockings and slippers, to make out with her foot the outlines and colours of a picture hidden under a carpet. Other experiments showed that her knees and shoulders had a similar sensitivity. During all these tests Vera was blindfold; and, indeed, except when blindfold she lacked the ability to perceive things with her skin. It was also found that although she could perceive things with her fingers this ability ceased the moment her hands were wet.\nERIC DE MAUNY Seeing hands from The Listener\n",

"text":"Waves are the children of the struggle between ocean and atmosphere, the ongoing signatures of infinity. Rays from the sun excite and energize the atmosphere of the earth, awakening it to flow, to movement, to rhythm, to life. The wind then speaks the message of the sun to the sea and the sea transmits it on through waves -- an ancient, exquisite, powerful message.\nThese ocean waves are among the earth's most complicated natural phenomena. The basic features include a crest (the highest point of the wave), a trough (the lowest point), a height (the vertical distance from the trough to the crest), a wave length (the horizontal distance between two wave crests), and a period (which is the time it takes a wave crest to travel one wave length).\nAlthough an ocean wave gives the impression of a wall of water moving in your direction, in actuality waves move through the water leaving the water about where it was. If the water was moving with the wave, the ocean and everything on it would be racing in to the shore with obviously catastrophic results.\nAn ocean wave passing through deep water causes a particle on the surface to move in a roughly circular orbit, drawing the particle first towards the advancing wave, then up into the wave, then forward with it and then -- as the wave leaves the particles behind -- back to its starting point again.\nFrom both maturity to death, a wave is subject to the same laws as any other 'living' thing. For a time it assumes a miraculous individuality that, in the end, is reabsorbed into the great ocean of life.\nThe undulating waves of the open sea are generated by three natural causes: wind, earth movements or tremors, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. Once waves have been generated, gravity is the force that drives them in a continual attempt to restore the ocean surface to a flat plain.\nfrom World Magazine (BBC Enterprises)\n",

"lastPosi":0,
"text":"Two main techniques have been used for training elephants, which we may respectively the tough and the gentle. The former method simply consists of setting an elephant to work and beating him until he does what is expected of him. Apart from moral considerations this is a stupid method of training, for it produces a resentful animal who at a later stage may well turn man-killer. The gentle method requires more patience in the early stages, but produces a cheerful, good-tempered elephant who will give many years of loyal service.\nThe first essential in elephant training is to assign to the animal a single mahout who will be entirely responsible for the job. Elephants like to have one master just as dogs do, and are capable of a considerable degree of personal affection. There are even stories of half-trained elephant calves who have refused to feed and pined to death when by some unavoidable circumstance they have been deprived of their own trainer. Such extreme cases must probably be taken with a grain of salt, but they do underline the general principle that the relationship between elephant and mahout is the key to successful training.\nThe most economical age to capture an elephant for training is between fifteen and twenty years, for it is then almost ready to undertake heavy work and can begin to earn its keep straight away. But animals of this age do not easily become subservient to man, and a very time man, and a very firm hand must be employed in the early stages. The captive elephant, still roped to a tree, plunges and screams every time a man approaches, and for several days will probably refuse all food through anger and fear. Sometimes a tame elephant is tethered nearby to give the wild one confidence, and in most cases the captive gradually quietens down and begins to accept its food. The next stage is to get the elephant to the training establishment, a ticklish business which is achieved with the aid of two tame elephants roped to the captive on either side.\nWhen several elephants are being trained at one time, it is customary for the new arrival to be placed between the stalls of two captives whose training is already well advanced. It is then left completely undisturbed with plenty of food and water so that it can absorb the atmosphere of its new home and see that nothing particularly alarming is happening to its companions. When it is eating normally, its own training begins. The trainer stands in front of the elephant holding a long stick with a sharp metal point. Two assistants, mounted on tame elephants, control the captive from either side, while others rub their hands over his skin to the accompaniment of a monotonous and soothing chant. This is supposed to induce pleasurable sensations in the elephant, and its effects are reinforced by the use of endearing epithets. The elephant is not son', or 'ho! my father', or 'my mother', according to the age and sex of the captive. The elephant is not immediately susceptible to such blandishments, however, and usually lashes fiercely with its trunk in all directions. These movements are controlled by the trainer with the metal-pointed stick, and the trunk eventually becomes so sore that the elephant curls it up and seldom afterwards uses it for offensive purposes.\nRICHARD CARRINGTON Elephants\n",

"text":"An earthquake comes like a thief in the night, without warning. It was necessary, therefore, to invent instruments that neither slumbered nor slept. Some devices were quite simple. One, for instance, consisted of rods of various lengths and thicknesses with would stand up end like ninepins. When a shock came, it shook the rigid table upon which these stood. If it were gentle, only the more unstable rods fell. If it were severe, they all fell. Thus the rods, by falling, and by the direction in which they fell, recorded for the severe, they all fell. Thus the rods, by falling, and by the direction in which they fell, recorded for the slumbering scientist the strength of a shock that was too weak to waken him, and the direction from which it came.\nBut instruments far more deliecate than that were needed if any really serious advance was to be made. The ideal to be aimed at was to devise an instrument that could record with a pen on paper, the movements of the ground or of the table as the quake passed by. While I write my pen moves, but the paper keeps still. With practice, no doubt, I could in time learn to write by holding the pen still while the paper moved. That sounds a silly suggestion, but that was precisely the idea adopted in some of the early instruments (seismometers) for recording earthquake waves. But when table, penholder and paper are all moving, how is it possible to write legibly? The key to a solution of that problem lay in an everyday observation. Why does a person standing in a bus or train tend to fall when a sudden start is made? It is because his feet move on , but his head stays still. A simple experiment will help us a little further. Tie a heavy weight at the end of a long piece of string. With the hand to and fro and around but not up and string so that the weight nearly touches the ground. Now move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down. It will be found that the weight a piece of string. With the hand held high in the air, hold the string so that the weight nearly touches the ground. Now move the hand to and fro and around but not up and down. It will be found that ten weight moves but slightly or not at all. Imagine an earthquake shock shaking the floor, the paper, you and your hand. In the midst of all this movement, the weight and the pen would be still. But as the paper moved from side to side under the pen point, its movement would be recorded in ink upon its surface. It was upon this principle that the first instruments were made, but while the drum was being shaken, the line that the pen was drawing wriggled from side to side. The apparatus thus described, however, records only the horizontal component of the wave movement, which is, in fact, much more complicated. If we could actually see the path described by a particle, such as a sand grain in the rock, it would be more like that of a bluebottle path described by a particle, such as a sand grain in the rock, it would be more like that of a bluebottle buzzing round the room; it would be up and down, to and fro and from side to side. Instruments have been devised and can be so placed that all three elements can be recorded in different graphs.\nWhen the instrument is situated at more than 700 miles from the earthquake centre, the graphic record shows three waves arriving one after at short intervals. The first records the arrival of longitudinal vibrations. The second marks the arrival of transverse vibrations which travel more slowly and arrive several minutes after the first. These two have travelled through the earth. It was from the study of these that so much was learnt about the interior of the earth. The third, or main. The third, or main wave, is the slowest and has travelled round the earth through the surface rocks.\nH.H,SWINNERTON The Earth beneath Us\n",

"text":"We must conclude from the work of those who have studied the origin of life, that given a planet only approximately like our own, life is almost certain to start. Of all the planets in our solar system, we ware now pretty certain the Earth is the only one on which life can survive. Mars is too dry and poor in oxygen, Venus far too hot, and so is Mercury, and the outer planets have temperatures near absolute zero and hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. But other suns, start as the astronomers call them, are bound to have planets like our own, and as is the number of stars in the universe is so vast, this possibility becomes virtual certainty. There are one hundred thousand million starts in our own Milky Way alone, and then there are exist is now estimated at about 300 million million.\nAlthough perhaps only 1 per cent of the life that has started somewhere will develop into highly complex and intelligent patterns, so vast is the number of planets, that intelligent life is bound to be a natural part of the universe.\nIf then we are so certain that other intelligent life exists in the universe, why have we had no visitors from outer space yet? First of all, they may have come to this planet of ours thousands or millions of years ago, and found our then prevailing primitive state completely uninteresting to their own advanced knowledge. Professor Ronald Bracewell, a leading American radio astronomer, argued in Nature that such a superior civilization, on a visit to our own solar system, may have left an automatic messenger behind to await the possible awakening of an advanced civilization. Such a messenger, receiving our radio and television signals, might well re-transmit them back to its home-planet, although what impression any other civilization would thus get from us is best left unsaid.\nBut here we come up against the most difficult of all obstacles to contact with people on other planets -- the astronomical distances which separate us. As a reasonable guess, they might, on an average, be 100 light years away. (A light year is the distance which light travels at 186,000 miles per second in one year, namely 6 million million miles.) Radio waves also travel at the speed of light, and assuming such an automatic messenger picked up our first broadcasts of the 1920's, the message to its home planet is barely halfway there. Similarly, our own present primitive chemical rockets, though good enough to orbit men, have no chance of transporting us to the nearest other star, four light years away, let alone distances of tens or hundreds of light years.\nFortunately, there is a 'uniquely rational way' for us to communicate with other intelligent beings, as Walter Sullivan has put it in his excellent book, We Are not Alone. This depends on the precise radio frequency of the 21-cm wavelength, or 1420 megacycles per second. It is the natural frequency of emission of the hydrogen atoms in space and was discovered by us in 1951; it must be known to any kind of radio astronomer in the universe.\nOnce the existence of this wave-length had been discovered, it was not long before its use as the uniquely recognizable broadcasting frequency for interstellar communication was suggested. Without something of this kind, searching for intelligences on other planets would be like trying to meet a friend in London without a pre-arranged rendezvous and absurdly wandering the streets in the hope of a chance encounter.\nANTHONY MICHAELIS Are There Strangers in Space? from The Weekend Telegraph\n",

"text":"Custom has not commonly been regarded as a subject of great moment. The inner workings of our won brains we feel to be uniquely worthy of investigation, but custom, we have a way of thinking, is behaviour at its most commonplace. As a matter of fact, it is the other way around. Traditional custom, taken the world over, is a mass of detailed behaviour more astonishing than what any one person can ever evolve in individual actions, no matter how aberrant. Yet that is a rather trivial aspect of the matter. The fact of first-rate importance is the predominant role that custom plays in experience and in belief, and the very great varieties it may manifest.\nNo man ever looks at the world with pristine eyes. He sees it edited by a definite set of customs and institutions and ways of thinking. Even in his philosophical probing he cannot go behind these stereotypes; his very concepts of the true and the false will still have reference to his particular traditional customs. John Dewey has said in all seriousness that the part played by custom in shaping the behaviour of the individual, as against any way in which he can affect traditional custom, is as the proportion of the total vocabulary of his mother tongue against those words of his own baby talk that are taken up into the vernacular of his family. When one seriously studies the social orders that have had the opportunity to develop autonomously, the figure becomes no more than an exact and matter-of-fact observation. The life history handed down in his community. From the moment of his birth, the customs into which he is born shape his experience and behaviour. By the time he can talk, he is the little creature of his culture, and by the time he is grown and able to take part in its activities, its habits are his habits, its beliefs his beliefs, its impossibilities his impossibilities. Every child that is born into his group will share them with him, and no child born into one on the opposite side of the globe can ever achieve the thousandth part. There is no social problem it is more incumbent upon us to understand than this of the role of custom. Until we are intelligent as to its laws and varieties, the main complicating facts of human life must remain unintelligible.\nThe study of custom can be profitable only after certain preliminary propositions have been accepted, and some of these propositions have been violently opposed. In the first place, any scientific study requires that there be no preferential weighting of one or another of the items in the series it selects for its consideration. In all the less controversial fields, like the study of cacti or termites or the mature of nebulae, the necessary method of study is to group the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this way, we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. It is only in the relevant material and to take note of all possible variant forms and conditions. In this way, we have learned all that we know of the laws of astronomy, or of the habits of the social insects, let us say. It is only in the study of man himself that the major social sciences have substituted the study of one local variation, that of Western civilization.\nAnthropology was by definition impossible, as long as these distinctions between ourselves and the primitive, ourselves and the barbarian, ourselves and the pagan, held sway over people's minds. It was necessary first to arrive at that degree of sophistication where we no longer set our own belief against our neighbour's superstition. It was necessary to recognize that these institutions which are based on the same premises, let us say the supernatural, must be considered together, our own among the rest.\nRUTH BENEDICT Patterns of Culture\n",

Indeed, we lack practice and experience nowadays in dealing with primitive conditions. I am sure that, without modern weapons, I would make a very poor show of disputing the ownership of a cave with a bear, and in this I do not think that I stand alone. The last creature to compete with man was the mosquito. But even the mosquito has been subdued by attention to drainage and by chemical sprays.\nCompetition between our selves, person against person, community against community, still persists, however; and it is as fierce as it ever was.\nBut the competition of man against man is not the simple process envisioned in biology. It is not a simple competition for a fixed amount of food determined by the physical environment, because the environment that determines our evolution is no longer essentially physical. Our environment is chiefly conditoned by the things we believe. Morocco and California are bits of the Earth in very similar latitudes, both on the west coasts of continents with similar climates, and probably with rather similar natural resources. Yet their present development is wholly different, not so much because of different people wish to emphasize. The most important factor in our environment is the state of our own minds.\nIt is well known that where the white man has invaded a primitive culture, the most destructive effects have come not from physical weapons but from ideas. Ideas are dangerous. The Holy Office knew this full well when it caused heretics to be burned in days gone by. Indeed, the concept of free speech only exists in our modern society because when you are inside a community, you are conditioned by the conventions of the community to such a degree that it is very difficult to conceive of anything really destructive. It is only someone looking on from outside that can inject the dangerous thoughts. I do not doubt that it would be possible to inject ideas into the modern world that would utterly destroy us. I would like to give you an example, but fortunately I cannot do so. Perhaps it will suffice to mention the unclear bomb. Of making the effect on a reasonably advanced technological society, one that still does not possess the bomb, of making it aware of the possibility, of supplying sufficient details to enable the thing to be constructed. Twenty or thirty pages of information handed to any of the major world powers around the year 1925 would have been sufficient to change the course of world history. It is a strange thought, but I believe a correct one, that twenty or thirty pages of ideas and information would be capable of turning the present-day world upside down, or even destroying it. I have often tried to conceive of what those pages might contain, but of course outside the particular patterns that our brains are conditioned to, or, to be more accurate, we can think only a very little way outside, and then only if we are very original.\nFRED HOYLE Of Men and Galaxies\n",

The stronger the will, the more futile the task. One can only gently insinuate something else into its convulsive grasp. And if this something else is rightly chosen, if it really attended by the illumination of another field of interest, gradually, and often quite swiftly, the old undue grip relaxes and the process of recuperation and repair begins.\nThe cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of the first importance to a public man. But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly improvised by a mere command of the will. The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. The seeds must by carefully chosen; they must fall on good ground; they must be sedulously tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed.\nTo be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. It is no use starting late in life to say: 'I will take an interest in this or that.' Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort. A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet get hardly any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like; you have got to like what you do. Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are toiled to death, those who are worried to hard week's sweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball or Saturday afternoon. It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or business man, who has beer working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.\nAs for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire -- for them a new pleasure, a new excitement if only an additional satiation. In vain they rush frantically round from place to place, trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere clatter and motion. For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path.\nIt may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human being are divided into two classes: first, one. Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of sustenance, but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune's of sustenance, but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and modest forms. But Fortune's favoured children belong to the second class. Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays, when they come, are grudged as enforced as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes, the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, of a diversion of effort, is essential.

But, contrary to a popular assumption, it is far from being the only one, or even the greatest. The man who manoeuvres carelessly into his twenty pounds' worth of space at one of Europe's myriad permanent sites may find himself bumping a Bentley. More likely, Ford Escort will be hub to hub with Renault or Mercedes, but rarely with bicycles made for two.\nThat the equipment of modern camping becomes yearly more sophisticated is an entertaining paradox for the cynic, a brighter promise for the hopeful traveler who has sworn to get away from it all. It also provides-and some student sociologist might care to base his thesis upon the phenomenon -- an escape of another kind. The modern traveller is often a man who dislikes the Splendide and the Bellavista, not because he cannot afford, or shuns their material comforts. but because he is afford of them. Affluent he may be, but he is by no means sure what to tip the doorman or the chambermaid. Master in his own house, he has little idea of when to say boo to a maitre d'hotel.\nFrom all such fears camping releases him. Granted, a snobbery of camping itself, based upon equipment and techniques, already exists; but it is of a kind that, if he meets it, he can readily understand and deal with. There is no superior 'they' in the shape of managements and hotel hierarchies to darken his holiday days.\nTo such motives, yet another must be added. The contemporary phenomenon of car worship is to be explained not least by the sense of independence and freedom that ownership entails. To this pleasure camping gives an exquisite refinement.\nFrom one's own front door to home or foreign hills or sands and back again, everything is to hand. Not only are the means of arriving at the holiday paradise entirely within one's own command and keeping, but the means of escape from holiday hel (if the beach proves too crowded, the local weather too inclement) are there, outside -- or, as likely, part of -- the tent.\nIdealists have objected to the package tour, that the traveller abroad thereby denies himself the opportunity of getting to know the people of the country visited. Insularity and self-containment, it is argued, go hand in hand. The opinion does not survive experience of a popular Continental camping place. Holiday hotels tend to cater for one nationality of visitors especially, sometimes exclusively. Camping sites, by contrast, are highly cosmopolitan. Granted, a preponderance of Germans is a characteristic that seems common to most Mediterranean sites; but as yet there is no overwhelmingly specialized patronage. Notices forbidding the open-air drying of clothes, or the use of water points for car washing, or those inviting 'our camping friends' to a dance or a boat trip are printed not only in French or Italian or Spanish, but also in English, German and Dutch. At meal times the odour of sauerkraut vies with that of garlic. The Frenchman's breakfast coffee competes with the Englishman's bacon and eggs.\nWhether the remarkable growth of organized camping means the eventual death of the more independent kind is hard to say. Municipalities naturally want to secure the campers' site fees and other custom. Police are wary of itinerants who cannot be traced to a recognized camp boundary or to four walls. But most probably it will all depend upon campers themselves: how many heath fires they cause; how much litter they leave; in short, whether or not they wholly alienate landowners and those who live in the countryside. Only good scouting is likely to preserve the freedoms so dear to the heart of the eternal Boy Scout.\nNIGEL BUXTON The Great Escape from The Weekend Telegraph\n",

There is only one difference between an old man and a young one: the young man has a glorious future before him and the old one has a splendid future behind him: and maybe that is where the rub is.\nWhen I was a teenager, I felt that I was just young and uncertain -- that I was a new boy in a huge school, and I would have been very pleased to be regarded as something so interesting as a problem. For one thing, being a problem gives you a certain identity, and that is one of the things the young are busily engaged in seeking.\nI find young people exciting. They have an air of freedom, and they not a dreary commitment to mean ambitions or love of comfort. They are not anxious social climbers, and they have no devotion to material things. All this seems to me to link them with life, and the origins of things. It's as if they were, in some sense, cosmic beings in violent and lovely contrast with us suburban creatures. All that is in my mind when I meet a young person. He may be conceited, ill-mannered, presumptuous or fatuous, but I do not turn for protection to dreary cliches about respect of elders -- as if mere age were a reason for respect. I accept that we are equals, and I will argue with him, as an equal, if I think he is wrong.\n\nFIELDEN HUGHES from Out of the Air, The Listener\n",

"text":"I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill between the nations, and that if only the common peoples of the would could meet one another at football or cricket, they would have no inclination to meet on the hattlefield. Even if one didn't know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce if from general principles.\nNearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little meaning unless you do your utmost to win. On the village green, where you pick up sides and no feeling of local patriotism is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as a the question of prestige arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if you lose, the most savage combative instincts are aroused. Anyone who has played even in a school football match knows this. At the international level, sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously believe -- at any rate for short periods -- that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national virtue.\nGEORGE ORWELL The sporting spirit\n",

"text":"Not all sounds made by animals serve as language, and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.\nTo get a full appreciation of what this means we must turn first to some recent human inventions. Everyone knows that if he shouts in the vicinity of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come back. The further off this solid obstruction, the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo. A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes, the depth of the sea at that point can be calculated. So was born the echo-sounding apparatus, now in general use in ships. Every solid object will reflect a sound, varying according to the size and nature of the object. A shoal of fish will do this. So it is a comparatively simple step from locating the sea bottom to locating a shoal of fish. With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but to tell if it is herring, cod, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.\nIt has been found that certain bats emit squeaks and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and steer clear of obstacles -- or locate flying insects on which they feed. This echo-location in bats is often compared with radar, the principle of which is similar.\nMAURICE BURTON Curiosities of animal life\n",

"text":"Chickens slaughtered in the United States, claim officials in Brussels, are not fit to grace European tables. No, say the American: our fowl are fine, we simply clean them in a different way. These days, it is differences in national regulations, far more than tariffs, that put sand in the wheels of trade between rich countries. It is not just farmers who are complaining. An electric razor that meets the European Union's safety standards must be approved by American testers before it can be sold in the United States, and an American-made dialysis machine needs the EU's okay before is hits the market in Europe.\nAs it happens, a razor that is safe in Europe is unlikely to electrocute Americans. So, ask businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, why have two lots of tests where one would do? Politicians agree, in principle, so America and the EU have been trying to reach a deal which would eliminate the need to double-test many products. They hope to finish in time for a trade summit between America and the EU on May 28TH. Although negotiators are optimistic, the details are complex enough that they may be hard-pressed to get a deal at all.\nWhy? One difficulty is to construct the agreements. The Americans would happily reach one accord on standards for medical devices and them hammer out different pacts covering, say, electronic goods and drug manufacturing. The EU -- following fine continental traditions -- wants agreement on general principles, which could be applied to many types of products and perhaps extended to other countries.\nFrom: The Economist, May 24th, 1997\n",

"text":"Alfred the Great acted his own spy, visiting Danish camps disguised as a minstrel. In those days wandering minstrels were welcome everywhere. They were not fighting men, and their harp was their passport. Alfred had learned many of their ballads in his youth, and could vary his programme with acrobatic tricks and simple conjuring.\nWhile Alfred's little army slowly began to gather at Athelney, the king himself set out to penetrate the camp of Guthrum, the commander of the Danish invaders. There had settled down for the winter at Chippenham: thither Alfred went. He noticed at once that discipline was slack: the Danes had the self-confidence of conquerors, and their security precautions were casual. They lived well, on the proceeds of raids on neighbouring regions. There they collected women as well as food and drink, and a life of ease had made them soft.\nAlfred stayed in the camp a week before he returned to Athelney. The force there assembled was trivial compared with the Danish horde. But Alfred had deduced that the Danes were no longer fit for prolonged battle: and that their commissariat had no organization, but depended on irregular raids.\nSo, faced with the Danish advance, Alfred did not risk open battle but harried the enemy. He was constantly on the move, drawing the Danes after him. His patrols halted the raiding parties: hunger assailed the Danish army. Now Alfred began a long series of skirmishes -- and within a month the Danes had surrendered. The episode could reasonably serve as a unique epic of royal espionage!\nBERNARD NEWMAN Spies in Britain\n\n\n\nUnit 2\n",

"text":"吴敬梓\n范进进学回家，母亲、妻子，俱各欢喜。正待烧锅做饭，只见他丈人胡屠户，手里拿着一副大肠和一瓶酒，走了进来。范进向他作揖，坐下。胡屠户道：“我自倒运，把个女儿嫁与你这现世宝穷鬼，历年以来，不知累了我多少。如今不知因我积了甚么德，带挈你中了个相公，我所以带个酒来贺你。”范进唯唯连声，叫浑家把肠子煮了，烫起酒来，在茅草棚下坐着。母亲自和媳妇在厨下造饭。胡屠户又吩咐女婿道：“你如今即中了相公，凡事要立起个体统来。比如我这行事里都是些正经有脸面的人，又是你的长亲，你怎敢在我们跟前装大？若是家门口这些做田的，扒粪的，不过是平头百姓，你若同他拱手作揖，平起平坐，这就是坏了学校规矩，连我脸上都无光了。你是个烂忠厚没用的人，所以这些话我不得不教导你，免得惹人笑话。”范进道：“岳父见教的是。”胡屠户又道：“亲家母也来这里坐着吃饭。老人家每日小菜饭，想也难过。我女孩儿也吃些，自从进了你家门，这十几年，不知猪油可曾吃过两三回哩！可怜！可怜！”说罢，婆媳两个都来坐着吃了饭。吃到日西时分，胡屠户吃的醺醺的。这里母子两个，千恩万谢。屠户横披了衣服，腆着肚子去了。\n次日，范进少不得拜拜乡邻。魏好古又约了一班同案的朋友，彼此来往。因是乡试年，做了几个文会。不觉到了六月尽间，这些同案的人约范进去乡试。范进因没有盘费，走去同丈人商议，被胡屠户一口啐在脸上，骂了一个狗血喷头道：“不要失了你的时了！你自己只觉得中了一个相公，就‘癞虾蟆想吃起天鹅肉’来！我听见人说，就是中相公时，也不是你的文章，还是宗师看见你老，不过意，舍与你的。如今痴心就想中起老爷来！这些中老爷的都是天上的‘文曲星’！你不看见城里张府上那些老爷，都有万贯家私，一个个方面大耳。像你这尖嘴猴腮，也该撒抛尿自己照照！不三不四，就想天鹅屁吃！趁早收了这心，明年在我们行事里替你寻一个馆，每年寻几两银子，养活你那老不死的老娘和你老婆是正经！你问我借盘缠，我一天杀一个猪还赚不得钱把银子，都把与你去丢在水里，叫我一家老小嗑西北风！”一顿夹七夹八，骂的范进摸门不着。辞了丈人回来，自心里想：“宗师说我火候已到，自古无场外的举人，如不进去考他一考，如何甘心？”因向几个同案商议，瞒着丈人，到城里乡试。出了场，即便回家。家里已是饿了两三天。被胡屠户知道，又骂了一顿。\n到出榜那日，家里没有早饭米，母亲吩咐范进道：“我有一只生蛋的母鸡，你快拿集上去卖了，买几升米来煮餐粥吃，我已是饿的两眼都看不见了。”范进慌忙抱了鸡，走出门去。才去不到两个时候，只听得一片声的锣响，三匹马闯将来。那三个人下了马，把马拴在茅草棚上，一片声叫道：“快请范老爷出来，恭喜高中了！”母亲不知是甚事，吓得躲在屋里；听见中了，方敢伸出头来说道：“诸位请坐，小儿方才出去了。”那些报录人道：“原来是老太太。”本家簇拥着要喜钱。正在吵闹，又是几匹马，二报、三报到了，挤了一屋的人，茅草棚地下都坐满了。邻居都来了，挤着看。老太太没奈何，只得央及一个邻居去寻她儿子。\n那邻居飞奔到集上，一地里寻不见；直寻到集东头，见范进抱着鸡，手里插个草标，一步一踱的，东张西望，在那里寻人买。邻居道：“范相公，快些回去。你恭喜中了举人，报喜人挤了一屋里。”范进道是哄他，只装不听见，低着头，往前走。邻居见他不理，走上来，就要夺他手里的鸡。范进道：“你夺我的鸡怎的？你又不买。”邻居道：“你中了举了，叫你家去打发报子哩。”范进道：“高邻，你晓得我今日没有米，要卖这鸡去救命，为甚么拿这话来混我？我又不同你顽，你自回去罢，莫误了我卖鸡。”邻居见他不信，劈手把鸡夺了，掼在地下，一把拉了回来。报录人见了道：“好了，新贵人回来了。”正要拥着他说话。范进三两步走进屋里来，见中间报帖已经升挂起来，上写道：“捷报贵府老爷范讳进高中广东乡试第七名亚元。京报连登黄甲。”\n范进不看便罢，看了一遍，又念一遍，自己把两手拍了一下，笑了一声道：“噫！好了！我中了！”说着，往后一交！跌倒，牙关咬紧，不省人事。老太太慌了，慌将几口开水灌了过来，他爬将起来，又拍着手大笑道：“噫！好！我中了！”笑着，不由分说，就往门外飞跑，把报录人和邻居都吓了一跳。走出大门不多路，一脚踹在塘里，挣起来，头发都跌散了，两手黄泥，淋淋漓漓一身的水，众人拉他不住，拍着笑着，一直走到集上去了。众人大眼望小眼，一齐道：“原来新贵人欢喜疯了。”老太太哭道：“怎生这样苦命的事！中了一个甚么举人，就得了这个拙病！这一疯了，几时才得好？”娘子胡氏道：“早上好好出去，怎的就得了这样的病！却是如何是好？”众邻居劝道：“老太太不要心慌。我们而今且派两个人跟定了范老爷。这里众人家里拿些鸡蛋酒米，且管待了报子上的老爹们，再为商酌。”\n当下众邻居有拿鸡蛋来的，有拿白酒来的，也有背了斗米来的，也有捉两只鸡来的。娘子哭哭啼啼，在厨下收拾齐了，拿在草棚下。邻居又搬些桌凳，请报录的坐着吃酒，商议：“他这疯了，如何是好？”报录的内中有一个人道：“在下倒有一个主意，不知可以行得行不得？”众人问：“如何主意？”那人道：“范老爷平日可有最怕的人？他只因欢喜狠了，痰涌上来，迷了心窍。如今只消他怕的这个人来打他一个嘴巴，说：‘这报录的话都是哄你，你并不曾中。’他吃这一吓，把痰吐了出来，就明白了。”众邻都拍手道：“这个主意好得紧，妙得紧！范老爷怕的，莫过于肉案子上胡老爹。好了！快寻胡老爹来。他想是还不知道，在集上卖肉哩。”又一个人道：“在集上卖肉，他倒好知道了；他从五更鼓就往东头集上迎猪，还不曾回来。快些迎着去寻他。”\n一个人飞奔去迎，走到半路，遇着胡屠户来，后面跟着一个烧汤的二汉，提着七八斤肉，四五千钱，正来贺喜。进门见了老太太，老太太大哭着告诉了一番。胡屠户诧异道：“难道这等没福！”外边人一片声请胡老爹说话。胡屠户把肉和钱交与女儿，走了出来。众人如此这般，同他商议。胡屠户作难道：“虽然是我女婿，如今却做了老爷，就是天上的星宿。天上的星宿是打不得的！我听得斋公们说：打了天上的星宿，阎王就要拿去打一百铁棍，发在十八层地狱，永不得翻身。我却是不敢做这样的事！”邻居内一个尖酸人说道：“罢么！胡老爹！你每日杀猪的营生，白刀子进去，红刀子出来，阎王也不知叫判官的簿子上记了你几千条铁棍；就是添上这一百棍，也打甚么要紧？只恐把铁棍子打完了，也算不到这笔账上来。或者你救好了女婿的病，阎王叙功，从地狱里把你提上第十七层来，也不可知。”报录的人道：“不要只管讲笑话。胡老爹，这个事须是这般，你没奈何，权变一权变。”屠户被众人局不过，只得连斟两碗酒喝了，壮一壮胆，把方才这些小心收起，将平日的凶恶样子拿出来，卷一卷那油晃晃的衣袖，走上集去。众邻居五六个都跟着走。老太太赶出来叫道：“亲家，你只可吓他一吓，却不要把他打伤了！”众邻居道：“这自然，何消吩咐！”说着，一直去了。\n来到集上，见范进正在一个庙门口站着，散着头发，满脸污泥，鞋都跑掉了一只，兀自拍着掌，口里叫道：“中了！中了！”胡屠户凶神似的走到跟前，说道：“该死的畜生！你中了甚么？”一个嘴巴打将去。众人和邻居见这模样，忍不住的笑。不想胡屠户虽然大着胆子打了一下，心里到底还是怕的，那手早颤起来，不敢打到第二下。范进因这一个嘴巴，却也打晕了，昏倒于地。众邻居一齐上前，替他抹胸口，捶背心，舞了半日，渐渐喘息过来，眼睛明亮，不疯了。众人扶起，借庙门口一个外科郎中“跳驼子”板凳上坐着。胡屠户站在一边，不觉那只手隐隐的疼将起来；自己看时，把个巴掌仰着，再也弯不过来。自己心里懊恼道：“果然天上‘文曲星’是打不得的，而今菩萨计较起来了。”想一想，更疼的狠了，连忙问郎中讨了个膏药贴着。\n范进看了众人，说道：“我怎么坐在这里？”又道：“我这半日，昏昏沉沉，如在梦里一般。”众邻居道：“老爷，恭喜高中了。适才欢喜的有些引动了痰，方才吐出几口痰来，好了。快请回家去打发报录人。”范进说道：“是了。我也记得是中的第七名。”范进一面自绾了头发，一面问郎中借了一盆水洗洗脸。一个邻居早把那一只鞋寻了来，替他穿上。见丈人在跟前，恐怕又要来骂。胡屠户上前道：“贤婿老爷，方才不是我敢大胆，是你老太太的主意，央我来劝你的。”邻居内一个人道：“胡老爹方才这个嘴巴打的亲切，少顷范老爷洗脸，还要洗下半盆猪油来！”又一个道：“老爹，你这手明日杀不得猪了。”胡屠户道：“我那里还杀猪，有我这贤婿，还怕后半世靠不着也怎的？我每常说，我的这个贤婿，才学又高，品貌又好，就是城里头那张府、周府这些老爷，也没有我女婿这样一个体面的相貌！你们不知道，得罪你们说，我小老这一双眼睛，却是认得人的，想着先年，我小女在家里长到三十多岁，多少有钱的富户要和我结亲，我自己觉得女儿像有些福气的，毕竟要嫁与个老爷，今日果然不错！”说罢，哈哈大笑，众人都笑起来，看着范进洗了脸。郎中又拿茶来吃了，一同回家。范举人先走，屠户和邻居跟在后面。屠户见女婿衣裳后襟滚皱了许多，一路低着头替他扯了几十回。到了家门，屠户高声叫道：“老爷回府了！”老太太迎着出来，见儿子不疯，喜从天降。众人问报录的，已是家里把屠户送来的几千钱打发他们去了。范进拜了母亲，也拜谢丈人。胡屠户再三不安道：“些须几个钱，不够你赏人！”范进又谢了邻居。正待坐下，早看见一个体面的管家，手里拿着一个大红全帖，飞跑了进来：“张老爷来拜新中的范老爷。”说毕，轿子已是到了门口。胡屠户忙躲进女儿房里，不敢出来。邻居各自散了。\n范进迎了出去，只见那张乡绅下了轿进来，头戴纱帽，身穿葵花色员领，金带、皂靴。他是举人出身，做过一任知县的，别号静斋，同范进让了进来，到堂屋内平磕了头，分宾主坐下。张乡绅先攀谈道：“世先生同在桑梓，一向有失亲近。”范进道：“晚生久仰老先生，只是无缘，不曾拜会。”张乡绅道：“适才看见题名录，贵房师高要县汤公，就是先祖的门生，我和你是亲切的世弟兄。”范进道：“晚生侥幸，实是有愧。却幸得出老先生门下，可为欣喜。”张乡绅四面将眼睛望了一望，说道：“世先生果是清贫。”随在跟的家人手里拿过一封银子来，说道：“弟却也无以为敬，谨具贺仪五十两，世先生权且收着。这华居，其实住不得，将来当事拜往，俱不甚便。弟有空房一所，就在东门大街上，三进三间，虽不轩敞，也还干净，就送与世先生；搬到那里去住，早晚也好请教些。”范进再三推辞，张乡绅急了，道：“你我年谊世好，就如至亲骨肉一般，若要如此，就是见外了。”范进方才把银子收下，作揖谢了。又说了一会，打躬作别。胡屠户直等他上了轿，才敢走出堂屋来。\n范进即将这银子交与浑家打开看，一封一封雪白的细丝锭子，即便包了两锭，叫胡屠户进来，递与他道：“方才费老爹的心，拿了五千钱来。这六两多银子，老爹拿了去。”屠户把银子攥在手里紧紧的，把拳头舒过来，道：“这个，你且收着。我原是贺你的，怎好又拿了回去？”范进道：“眼见得我这里还有这几两银子，若用完了，再来问老爹讨来用。”屠户连忙把拳头缩了回去，往腰里揣，口里说道：“也罢，你而今相与了这个张老爷，何愁没有银子用？他家里的银子，说起来比皇帝家还多些哩！他家就是我卖肉的主顾，一年就是无事，肉也要用四五千斤，银子何足为奇！”又转回头来望着女儿说道：“我早上拿了钱来，你那该死行瘟的兄弟还不肯，我说：‘姑老爷今非昔比，少不得有人把银子送上门来给他用，只怕姑老爷还不希罕。’今日果不其然！如今拿了银子家去骂这死砍头短命的奴才！”说了一会，千恩万谢，低着头，笑迷迷的去了。",

"text":"施耐庵\n次日早，起五更，在府里把担仗都摆在厅前。老都管和两个虞候又将一小担财帛，共十一担，拣了十一个壮健的厢禁军，都做脚夫打扮。杨志戴上凉笠儿，穿着青纱衫子，系了缠带行履麻鞋，跨口腰刀，提条朴刀。老都管也打扮做个客人模样。两个虞候假装做跟的伴当。各人都拿了条朴刀，又带几根藤条。梁中书付与了札付书呈。一行人都吃得饱了，在厅上拜辞了梁中书。看那军人担仗起程，杨志和谢都管、两个虞候监押着，一行共是十五人，离了梁府，出得北京城门，取大路投东京进发。五里单牌，十里双牌。此时正是五月半天气，虽是晴明得好，只是酷热难行。\n今日杨志这一行人，要取六月十五日生辰，只得在路途上行。自离了这北京五七日，端的只是起五更趁早凉便行，日中热时便歇。五七日后，人家渐少，行客又稀，一站站都是山路。杨志却要辰牌起身，申时便歇。那十一个厢禁军，担子又重，无有一个稍轻。天气热了，行不得，见着林子便要去歇息。杨志赶着催促要行，如若停住，轻则痛骂，重则藤条便打，逼赶要行。两个虞候虽只背些包裹行李，也气喘了行不上。杨志也嗔道：“你两个好不晓事！这干系须是俺的！你们不替洒家打这夫子，却在背后也慢慢地挨。这路上不是耍处。”那虞候道：“不是我两个要慢走，其实热了行不动，因此落后。前日只是趁早凉走，如今怎地正热里要行？正是好歹不均匀。”杨志道：“你这般说话，却似放屁。前日行的须是好地面，如今正是尴尬去处。若不日里赶过去，谁敢五更半夜走？”两个虞候口里不道，肚中寻思：“这厮不直得便骂人。”\n杨志提了朴刀，拿着藤条，自去赶那担子。两个虞候坐在柳阴树下等得老都管来。两个虞候告诉道：“杨家那厮，强杀只是我相公门下一个提辖，直这般做大！”老都管道：“须是我相公当面分付道：休要和他别拗。因此我不做声。这两日也看他不得。权且奈他。”两个虞候道：“相公也只是人情话儿，都管自做个主便了。”老都管又道：“且奈他一奈。”当日行到申牌时分，寻得一个客店里歇了。那十一个厢禁军雨汗通流，都叹气吹嘘，对老都管说道：“我们不幸做了军健，情知道被差出来。这般火似热的天气，又挑着重担。这两日又不拣早凉行，动不动老大藤条打来。都是一般父母皮肉，我们直恁地苦！”老都管道：“你们不要怨怅，巴到东京时，我自赏你。”众军汉道：“若是似都管看待我们时，并不敢怨怅。”又过了一夜。次日，天色未明，众人跳起来趁早凉起身去。杨志跳起来喝道：“那里去！且睡了，却理会。”众军汉道：“趁早不走，日里热时走不得，却打我们。”杨志大骂道：“你们省得甚么！”拿了藤条要打。众军忍气吞声，只得睡了。当日直到辰牌时分，慢慢地打火吃了饭走。一路上赶打着，不许投凉处歇。那十一个厢禁军口里喃喃讷讷地怨怅，两个虞候在老都管面前絮絮聒聒地搬口。老都管听了，也不着意，心内自恼他。\n话休絮繁。似此行了十四五日，那十四个人，没一个不怨怅杨志。当日客店里，辰牌时分，慢慢地打火吃了早饭行。正是六月初四日时节，天气未及晌午，一轮红日当天，没半点云彩，其日十分大热。\n当日行的路，都是山僻崎岖小径，南山北岭。却监着那十一个军汉，约行了二十余里路程。那军人们思量要去柳阴树下歇凉，被杨志拿着藤条打将来，喝道：“快走！教你早歇。”众军人看那天时，四下里无半点云彩，其时那热不可当。\n当时杨志催促一行人在山中僻路里行。看看日色当午，那石头上热了，脚疼走不得。众军汉道：“这般天气热，兀的不晒杀人。”杨志喝着军汉道：“快走！赶过前面冈子去，却再理会。”正行之间，前面迎着那土冈子。\n当时一行十五人奔上冈子来，歇下担仗，那十一人都去松阴树下睡倒了。杨志说道：“苦也！这里是甚么去处，你们却在这里歇凉！起来，快走！”众军汉道：“你便剁做我七八段，其实去不得了。”杨志拿起藤条，劈头劈脑打去。打得这个起来，那个睡倒，杨志无可奈何。只见两个虞候和老都管气喘急急，也巴到冈子上松树下坐了喘气。看这杨志打那军健，老都管见了，说道：“提辖，端的热了走不得，休见他罪过。”杨志道：“都管，你不知，这里正是强人出没的去处，地名叫做黄泥冈。闲常太平时节，白日里兀自出来劫人，休道是这般光景，谁敢在这里停脚！”两个虞候听杨志说了，便道：“我见你说好几遍了，只管把这话来惊吓人。”老都管道：“权且教他们众人歇一歇，略过日中行如何？”杨志道：“你也没分晓了，如何使得！这里下冈子去，兀自有七八里没人家。甚么去处，敢在此歇凉！”老都管道：“我自坐一坐了走，你自去赶他众人先走。”杨志拿着藤条喝道：“一个不走的，吃俺二十棍。”众军汉一齐叫将起来。数内一个分说道：“提辖，我们挑着百十斤担子，须不比你空手走的。你端的不把人当人！便是留守相公自来监押时，也容我们说一句。你好不知疼痒，只顾逞办！”杨志骂道：“这畜生不呕死俺，只是打便了。”拿起藤条，劈脸便打去。老都管喝道：“杨提辖且住，你听我说。我在东京太师府里做奶公时，门下官军见了无千无万，都向着我喏喏连声。不是我口浅，量你是个遭死的军人，相公可怜，抬举你做个提辖，比得草芥子大小的官职，直得恁地逞能。休说我是相公家都管，便是村庄一个老的，也合依我劝一劝，只顾把他们打，是何看待！”杨志道：“都管，你须是城市里人，生长在相府里，那里知道途路上千难万难。”老都管道：“四川、两广也曾去来，不曾见你这般卖弄。”杨志道：“如今须不比太平时节。”都管道：“你说这话该剜口割舌，今日天下怎地不太平？”\n杨志却待再要回言，只见对面松林里影着一个人在那里舒头探脑价望。杨志道：“俺说甚么，兀的不是歹人来了！”撇下藤条，拿了朴刀，赶入松林里来，喝一声道：“你这厮好大胆，怎敢看俺的行货！”只见松林里一字儿摆着七辆江州车儿，七个人脱得赤条条的在那里乘凉。一个鬓边老大一搭朱砂记，拿着一条朴刀，望杨志跟前来。七个人齐叫一声：“呵也！”都跳起来。杨志喝道：“你等是甚么人？”那七人道：“你是甚么人？”杨志又问道：“你等莫不是歹人？”那七人道：“你颠倒问，我等是小本经纪，那里有钱与你。”杨志道：“你等小本经纪人，偏俺有大本钱。”那七人问道：“你端的是甚么人？”杨志道：“你等且说那里来的人？”那七人道：“我等弟兄七人，是濠州人，贩枣子上东京去，路途打从这里经过。听得多人说，这里黄泥冈上如常有贼打劫客商。我等一面走，一头自说道：我七个只有些枣子，别无甚财赋，只顾过冈子来。上得冈子，当不过这热，权且在这林子里歇一歇，待晚凉了行。只听得有人上冈子来，我们只怕是歹人，因此使这个兄弟出来看一看。”杨志道：“原来如此，也是一般的客人。却才见你们窥望，惟恐是歹人，因此赶来看一看。”那七个人道：“客官请几个枣子了去。”杨志道：“不必。”提了朴刀，再回担边来。\n老都管道：“既是有贼，我们去休。”杨志说道：“俺只道是歹人，原来是几个贩枣子的客人。”老都管道：“似你方才说时，他们都是没命的。”杨志道：“不必相闹，俺只要没事便好。你们且歇了，等凉些走。”众军汉都笑了。杨志也把朴刀插在地上，自去一边树下坐了歇凉。没半碗饭时，只见远远地一个汉子，挑着一副担桶，唱上冈子来。唱道：“赤日炎炎似火烧，野田禾稻半枯焦。农夫心内如汤煮，楼上王孙把扇摇。”\n那汉子口里唱着，走上冈子来，松林里头歇下担桶，坐地乘凉。众军看见了，便问那汉子道：“你桶里是甚么东西？”那汉子应道：“是白酒。”众军道：“挑往那里去？”那汉子道：“挑去村里卖。”众军道：“多少钱一桶？”那汉子道：“五贯足钱。”众军商量道：“我们又热又渴，何不买些吃？也解暑气。”正在那里凑钱。杨志见了，喝道：“你们又做甚么？”众军道：“买碗酒吃。”杨志调过朴刀杆便打，骂道：“你们不得洒家言语，胡乱便要买酒吃，好大胆！”众军道：“没事又来捣乱。我们自凑钱买酒吃，干你甚事，也来打人。”杨志道：“你这村人理会的甚么！到来只顾吃嘴，全不晓得路途上的勾当艰难。多少好汉，被蒙汗药麻翻了。。”那挑酒的汉子看着杨志冷笑道：“你这客官好不晓事，早是我不卖与你吃，却说出这般没气力的话来。”\n正在松树边闹动争说，只见对面松林里那伙贩枣子的客人，都提着朴刀走出来问道：“你们做甚么闹？”那挑酒的汉子道：“我自挑这酒过冈子村里卖，热了在此歇凉。他众人要问我买些吃，我又不曾卖与他。这个客官道我酒里有甚么蒙汗药。你道好笑么？说出这般话来！”那七个客人说道：“我只道有歹人出来，原来是如此。说一声也不打紧。我们倒着买一碗吃。既是他们疑心，且卖一桶与我们吃。”那挑酒的道：“不卖，不卖！”这七个客人道：“你这汉子也不晓事，我们须不曾说你。你左右将到村里去卖，一般还你钱。便卖些与我们，打甚么不紧。看你不道得舍施了茶汤，便又救了我们热渴。”那挑酒的汉子便道：“卖一桶与你不争，只是被他们说的不好。又没碗瓢舀吃。”那七人道：“你这汉子忒认真，便说了一声打甚么不紧。我们自有椰瓢在这里。”只见两个客人去车子前取出两个椰瓢来，一个捧出一大捧枣子来。七个人立在桶边，开了桶盖，轮替换着舀那酒吃，把枣子过口。无一时，一桶酒都吃尽了。七个客人道：“正不曾问得你多少价钱？”那汉道：“我一了不说价，五贯足钱一桶，十贯一担。”七个客人道：“五贯便依你五贯，只饶我们一瓢吃。”那汉道：“饶不的，做定的价钱。”一个客人把钱还他，一个客人便去揭开桶盖，兜了一瓢，拿上便吃。那汉去夺时，这客人手拿半瓢酒，望松林里便走，那汉赶将去。只见这边一个客人从松林里走将出来，手里拿一个瓢，便来桶里舀了一瓢酒。那汉看见，抢来劈手夺住，望桶里一倾，便盖了桶盖，将瓢望地下一丢，口里说道：“你这客人好不君子相！戴头识脸的，也这般啰唣。”\n那对过众军汉见了，心内痒起来，都待要吃。数中一个看着老都管道：“老爷爷，与我们说一声。那卖枣子的客人买他一桶吃了，我们胡乱也买他这桶吃，润一润喉也好。其实热渴了，没奈何，这里冈子上又没讨水吃处。老爷方便！”老都管见众军所说，自心里也要吃得些，竟来对杨志说：“那贩枣子客人已买了他一桶酒吃，只有这一桶，胡乱教他们买了避暑气。冈子上端的没处讨水吃。”杨志寻思道：“俺在远远处望，这厮们都买他的酒吃了，那桶里当面也见吃了半瓢，想是好的。打了他们半日，胡乱容他买碗吃罢。”杨志道：“既然老都管说了，教这厮们买吃了便起身。”众军健听了这话，凑了五贯足钱来买酒吃。那卖酒的汉子道：“不卖了，不卖了！”便道：“这酒里有蒙汗药在里头。”众军陪着笑说道：“大哥，直得便还言语。”那汉道：“不卖了，休缠！”这贩枣子的客人劝道：“你这个汉子，他也说得差了，你也忒认真，连累我们也吃你说了几声。须不关他众人之事，胡乱卖与他众人吃些。”那汉道：“没事讨别人疑心做甚么。”这贩枣子客人把那卖酒的汉子推开一边，只顾将这桶酒提与众军去吃。那军汉开了桶盖，无甚舀吃，陪个小心，问客人借这椰瓢用一用。众客人道：“就送这几个枣子与你们过酒。”众军谢道：“甚么道理。”客人道：“休要相谢，都是一般客人，何争在这百十个枣子上。”众军谢了，先兜两瓢，叫老都管吃一瓢，杨提辖吃一瓢。杨志那里肯吃。老都管自先吃了一瓢。两个虞候各吃一瓢。众军汉一发上，那桶酒登时吃尽了。杨志见众人吃了无事，自本不吃，一者天气甚热，二乃口渴难熬，拿起来，只吃了一半，枣子分几个吃了。那卖酒的汉子说道：“这桶酒吃那客人饶两瓢吃了，少了你些酒，我今饶了你众人半贯钱罢。”众军汉把钱还他。那汉子收了钱，挑了空桶，依然唱着山歌，自下冈子去了。\n只见那七个贩枣子的客人，立在松树旁边，指着这一十五人说道：“倒也，倒也！”只见这十五个人，头重脚轻，一个个面面厮觑，都软倒了。那七个客人从松树林里推出这七辆江州车儿，把车子上枣子都丢在地上，将这十一担金珠宝贝，却装在车子内，叫声：“聒噪！”一直望黄泥冈下推了去。杨志口里只是叫苦，软了身体，扎挣不起。十五人眼睁睁地看着那七个人都把这金宝装了去，只是起不来，挣不动，说不的。\n我且问你：这七人端的是谁？不是别人，原来正是晁盖、吴用、公孙胜、刘唐、三阮这七个。却才那个挑酒的汉子，便是白日鼠白胜。却怎地用药？原来挑上冈子时，两桶都是好酒。七个人先吃了一桶，刘唐揭起桶盖，又兜了半瓢吃，故意要他们看着，只是教人死心塌地。次后，吴用去松林里取出药来，抖在瓢里，只做赶来饶他酒吃，把瓢去兜时，药已搅在酒里，假意兜半瓢吃，那白胜劈手夺来，倾在桶里。这个便是计策。那计较都是吴用主张。这个唤做“智取生辰纲”。",

"text":"曹雪芹\n贾母便笑道：“这屋里窄，再往别处逛去罢。”刘姥姥笑道：“人人都说：‘大家子住大房’，昨儿见了老太太正房，配上大箱、大柜、大桌子、大床，果然威武。那柜子比我们一间房子还大，还高。怪道后院子里有个梯子，我想又不上房晒东西，预备这梯子做什么？后来我想起来，一定是为开顶柜取东西；离了那梯子怎么上得去呢？如今又见了这小屋子，更比大的越发齐整了；满屋里东西都只好看，可不知叫什么。我越看越舍不得离了这里了！”凤姐道：“还有好的呢，我都带你去瞧瞧。”\n说着，一径离了潇湘馆，远远望见池中一群人在那里撑船。贾母道：“他们既备下船，咱们就坐一回。”说着，向紫菱洲蓼溆一带走来。未至池前，只见几个婆子手里都捧着一色摄丝戗金五彩大盒子走来，凤姐忙问王夫人：“早饭在那里摆？”王夫人道：“问老太太在那里就在那里罢了。”贾母听说，便回头说：“你三妹妹那里好，你就带了人摆去，我们从这里坐了船去。”\n凤姐儿听说，便回身和李纨、探春、鸳鸯、琥珀带着端饭的人等，抄着近路到了秋爽斋，就在晓翠堂上调开桌案。鸳鸯笑道：“天天咱们说外头老爷们：吃酒吃饭，都有个凑趣儿的，拿他取笑儿。咱们今儿也得了个女清客了。”李纨是个厚道人，倒不理会；凤姐儿却听着是说刘姥姥，便笑道：“咱们今儿就拿他取个笑儿。”二人便如此这般商议。李纨笑劝道：“你们一点好事儿不做！又不是个小孩儿，还这么淘气。仔细老太太说！”鸳鸯笑道：“很不与大奶奶相干，有我呢。”\n正说着，只见贾母等来了，各自随便坐下，先有丫鬟挨人递了茶，大家吃毕，凤姐手里拿着西洋布手巾，裹着一把乌木三镶银箸，按席摆下。贾母因说：“把那一张小楠木桌子抬过来，让刘亲家挨着我这边坐。”众人听说，忙抬过来。凤姐一面递眼色与鸳鸯，鸳鸯便忙拉刘姥姥出去，悄悄的嘱咐了刘姥姥一席话，又说：“这是我们家的规矩，要错了，我们就笑话呢。”\n调停已毕，然后归坐。薛姨妈是吃过饭来的，不吃了，只坐在一边吃茶。贾母带着宝玉、湘云、黛玉、宝钗一桌，王夫人带着迎春姐妹三人一桌，刘姥姥挨着贾母一桌。贾母素日吃饭，皆有小丫鬟在旁边拿着漱盂、麈尾、巾帕之物，如今鸳鸯是不当这差的了，今日偏接过麈尾来拂着。丫鬟们知他要捉弄刘姥姥，便躲开让他。鸳鸯一面侍立，一面递眼色。刘姥姥道：“姑娘放心。”\n那刘姥姥入了坐，拿起箸来，沉甸甸的不伏手，——原是凤姐和鸳鸯商议定了，单拿了一双老年四楞象牙镶金的筷子给刘姥姥。刘姥姥见了，说道：“这个叉巴子，比我们那里的铁锨还沉，那里拿的动他？”说的众人都笑起来。只见一个媳妇端了一个盒子站在当地，一个丫鬟上来揭去盒盖，里面盛着两碗菜，李纨端了一碗放在贾母桌上，凤姐偏拣了一碗鸽子蛋放在刘姥姥桌上。\n贾母这边说声“请”，刘姥姥便站起身来，高声说道：“老刘，老刘，食量大如牛：吃个老母猪，不抬头！”说完，却鼓着腮帮子，两眼直视，一声不语。众人先还发怔，后来一想，上上下下都一齐哈哈大笑起来。湘云掌不住，一口茶都喷出来。黛玉笑岔了气，伏着桌子只叫“嗳哟！”宝玉滚到贾母怀里，贾母笑的搂着叫“心肝”，王夫人笑的用手指着凤姐儿，却说不出话来。薛姨妈也掌不住，口里的茶喷了探春一裙子。探春的茶碗都合在迎春身上。惜春离了坐位，拉着他奶母，叫“揉揉肠子”。地下无一个不弯腰屈背，也有躲出去蹲着笑去的，也有忍着笑上来替他姐妹换衣裳的。独有凤姐鸳鸯二人掌着，还只管让刘姥姥。\n刘姥姥拿起箸来，只觉不听使，又道：“这里的鸡儿也俊，下的这蛋也小巧，怪俊的。我且得一个儿！”众人方住了笑，听见这话，又笑起来。贾母笑的眼泪出来，只忍不住；琥珀在后捶着。贾母笑道：“这定是凤丫头促狭鬼儿闹的！快别信他的话了。”\n那刘姥姥正夸鸡蛋小巧，凤姐儿笑道：“一两银子一个呢！你快尝尝罢，冷了就不好吃了。”刘姥姥便伸筷子要夹，那里夹的起来？满碗里闹了一阵，好容易撮起一个来，才伸着脖子要吃，偏又滑下来，滚在地下。忙放下筷子，要亲自去拣，早有地下的人拣出去了。刘姥姥叹道：“一两银子也没听见个响声儿就没了！”\n众人已没心吃饭，都看着他取笑。贾母又说：“谁这会子又把那个筷子拿出来了，又不请客摆大筵席！都是凤丫头支使的！还不换了呢。”地下的人原不曾预备这牙箸，本是凤姐和鸳鸯拿了来的，听如此说，忙收过去了，也照样换上一双乌木镶银的。刘姥姥道：“去了金的，又是银的，到底不及俺们那个伏手。”凤姐儿道：“菜里要有毒，这银子下去了就试的出来。”刘姥姥道：“这个菜里有毒，我们那些都成了砒霜了！那怕毒死了，也要吃尽了。”贾母见他如此有趣，吃的又香甜，把自己的菜也都端过来给他吃。又命一个老嬷嬷来，将各样的菜给板儿夹在碗上。\n一时吃毕，贾母等都往探春卧室中去闲话，这里收拾残桌，又放了一桌。刘姥姥看着李纨与凤姐儿对坐着吃饭，叹道：“别的罢了，我只爱你们家这行事！怪道说，‘礼出大家’。”凤姐儿忙笑道：“你可别多心，才刚不过大家取乐儿。”一言未了，鸳鸯也进来笑道：“姥姥别恼，我给你老人家赔个不是儿罢。”刘姥姥忙笑道：“姑娘说那里的话？咱们哄着老太太开个心儿，有什么恼的！你先嘱咐我，我就明白了，不过大家取笑儿。我要恼，也就不说了。”鸳鸯便骂人：“为什么不倒茶给姥姥吃！”刘姥姥忙道：“才刚那个嫂子倒了茶来，我吃过了，姑娘也该用饭了。”凤姐儿便拉鸳鸯坐下道：“你和我们吃罢，省了回来又闹。”鸳鸯便坐下了，婆子们添上碗箸来，三人吃毕。",

"text":"魏征\n臣闻求木之长者，必固其根本；欲流之远者，必浚其泉源；思国之安者，必积其德义。源不深而望流之远，根不固而求木之长，德不厚而思国之理，臣虽下愚，知其不可，而况于明哲乎！人君当神器之重，居域中之大，将崇极天之峻，永保无疆之休。不念居安思危，戒奢以俭，德不处其厚，情不胜其欲，斯亦伐根以求木茂，塞源而欲流长者也。\n凡百元首，承天景命，莫不殷忧而道著，功成而德衰。有善始者实繁，能克终者盖寡。岂取之易而守之难乎？昔取之而有余，今守之而不足，何也？夫在殷忧，必竭诚以待下；既得志，则纵情以傲物。竭诚则胡越为一体，傲物则骨肉为行路。虽董之以严刑，振之以威怒，终苟免而不怀仁，貌恭而不心服。怨不在大，可畏惟人；载舟覆舟，所宜深慎；奔车朽索，其可忽乎！\n君人者，诚能见可欲则思知足以自戒，将有作则思知止以安人，念高危则思谦冲而自牧，惧满溢则思江海下百川，乐盘游则思三驱以为度，忧懈怠则思慎始而敬终，虑壅蔽则思虚心以纳下，想谗邪则思正身以黜恶，恩所加则思无因喜以谬赏，罚所及则思无因怒而滥刑。总此十思，弘兹九德，简能而任之，择善而从之，则智者尽其谋，勇者竭其力，仁者播其惠，信者效其忠。文武争驰，在君无事，可以尽豫游之乐，可以养松、乔之寿，鸣琴垂拱，不言而化。何必劳神苦思，代下司职，役聪明之耳目，亏无为之大道哉！",

"text":"李斯\n臣闻吏议逐客，窃以为过矣。昔缪公求士，西取由余于戎，东得百里奚于宛，迎蹇叔于宋，来丕豹、公孙支于晋。此五子者，不产于秦，而缪公用之，并国二十，遂霸西戎。孝公用商鞅之法，移风易俗，民以殷盛，国以富强，百姓乐用，诸侯亲服，获楚、魏之师，举地千里，至今治强。惠王用张仪之计，拔三川之地，西并巴、蜀，北收上郡，南取汉中，包九夷，制鄢、郢，东据成皋之险，割膏腴之壤，遂散六国之从，使之西面事秦，功施到今。昭王得范雎，废穰侯，逐华阳，强公室，杜私门，蚕食诸侯，使秦成帝业。此四君者，皆以客之功。由此观之，客何负于秦哉！向使四君却客而不内，疏士而不用，是使国无富利之实而秦无强大之名也。\n今陛下致昆山之玉，有随、和之宝，垂明月之珠，服太阿之剑，乘纤离之马，建翠凤之旗，树灵鼍之鼓。此数宝者，秦不生一焉，而陛下说之，何也？必秦国之所生然后可，则是夜光之璧不饰朝廷，犀象之器不为玩好，郑、卫之女不充后宫，而骏良不实外厩，江南金锡不为用，西蜀丹青不为采。所以饰后宫、充下陈、娱心意、说耳目者，必出于秦然后可，则是宛珠之簪、傅玑之珥、阿缟之衣、锦绣之饰不进于前，而随俗雅化佳冶窈窕赵女不立于侧也。夫击瓮叩缶，弹筝搏髀，而歌呼呜呜快耳者，真秦之声也；《郑》《卫》《桑间》，《昭》《虞》《武》《象》者，异国之乐也。今弃击瓮叩缶而就《郑》《卫》，退弹筝而取《昭》《虞》，若是者何也？快意当前，适观而已矣。今取人则不然，不问可否，不论曲直，非秦者去，为客者逐。然则是所重者在乎色、乐、珠玉，而所轻者在乎人民也。此非所以跨海内、制诸侯之术也。\n臣闻地广者粟多，国大者人众，兵强则士勇。是以太山不让土壤，故能成其大；河海不择细流，故能就其深；王者不却众庶，故能明其德。是以地无四方，民无异国，四时充美，鬼神降福，此五帝三王之所以无敌也。今乃弃黔首以资敌国，却宾客以业诸侯，使天下之士退而不敢西向，裹足不入秦，此所谓“藉寇兵而赍盗粮”者也。\n夫物不产于秦，可宝者多；士不产于秦，而愿忠者众。今逐客以资敌国，损民以益仇，内自虚而外树怨于诸侯，求国无危，不可得也。",

"text":"司马迁\n屈原者，名平，楚之同姓也。为楚怀王左徒。博闻强志，明于治乱，娴于辞令。入则与王图议国事，以出号令；出则接遇宾客，应对诸侯。王甚任之。\n上官大夫与之同列，争宠而心害其能。怀王使屈原造为宪令，屈平属草稿未定，上官大夫见而欲夺之，屈平不与。因谗之曰：“王使屈平为令，众莫不知。每一令出，平伐其功，曰以为‘非我莫能为’也。”王怒而疏屈平。\n屈平疾王听之不聪也，谗谄之蔽明也，邪曲之害公也，方正之不容也，故忧愁幽思而作《离骚》。“离骚”者，犹离忧也。夫天者，人之始也；父母者，人之本也。人穷则反本，故劳苦倦极，未尝不呼天也；疾痛惨怛，未尝不呼父母也。屈平正道直行，竭忠尽智以事其君，谗人间之，可谓穷矣。信而见疑，忠而被谤，能无怨乎？屈平之作《离骚》，盖自怨生也。《国风》好色而不淫，《小雅》怨诽而不乱。若《离骚》者，可谓兼之矣。上称帝喾，下道齐桓，中述汤、武，以刺世事。明道德之广崇，治乱之条贯，靡不毕见。其文约，其辞微，其志洁，其行廉。其称文小而其指极大，举类迩而见义远。其志洁，故其称物芳；其行廉，故死而不容。自疏濯淖污泥之中，蝉蜕于浊秽，以浮游尘埃之外，不获世之滋垢，皭然泥而不滓者也。推此志也，虽与日月争光可也。\n屈平既绌，其后秦欲伐齐，齐与楚从亲。惠王患之，乃令张仪详去秦，厚币委质事楚，曰：“秦甚憎齐，齐与楚从亲，楚诚能绝齐，秦愿献商於之地六百里。”楚怀王贪而信张仪，遂绝齐，使使如秦受地。张仪诈之曰：“仪与王约六里，不闻六百里。”楚使怒去，归告怀王。怀王怒，大兴师伐秦。秦发兵击之，大破楚师于丹、淅，斩首八万，虏楚将屈匄，遂取楚之汉中地。怀王乃悉发国中兵，以深入击秦，战于蓝田。魏闻之，袭楚至邓。楚兵惧，自秦归。而齐竟怒不救楚，楚大困。\n明年，秦割汉中地与楚以和。楚王曰：“不愿得地，愿得张仪而甘心焉。”张仪闻，乃曰：“以一仪而当汉中地，臣请往如楚。”如楚，又因厚币用事者臣靳尚，而设诡辩于怀王之宠姬郑袖。怀王竟听郑袖，复释去张仪。是时屈平既疏，不复在位，使于齐，顾反，谏怀王曰：“何不杀张仪？”怀王悔，追张仪，不及。\n其后诸侯共击楚，大破之，杀其将唐眜。\n时秦昭王与楚婚，欲与怀王会。怀王欲行，屈平曰：“秦，虎狼之国，不可信。不如毋行。”怀王稚子子兰劝王行：“奈何绝秦欢？”怀王卒行。入武关，秦伏兵绝其后，因留怀王，以求割地。怀王怒，不听。亡走赵，赵不内。复之秦，竟死于秦而归葬。\n长子顷襄王立，以其弟子兰为令尹。楚人既咎子兰以劝怀王入秦而不反也。屈平既嫉之，虽放流，眷顾楚国，系心怀王，不忘欲反，冀幸君之一悟，俗之一改也。其存君兴国而欲反覆之，一篇之中三致志焉。然终无可奈何，故不可以反。卒以此见怀王之终不悟也。人君无愚、智、贤、不肖，莫不欲求忠以自为，举贤以自佐；然亡国破家相随属，而圣君治国累世而不见者，其所谓忠者不忠，而所谓贤者不贤也。怀王以不知忠臣之分，故内惑于郑袖，外欺于张仪，疏屈平而信上官大夫、令尹子兰，兵挫地削，亡其六郡，身客死于秦，为天下笑。此不知人之祸也。......\n令尹子兰闻之，大怒，卒使上官大夫短屈原于顷襄王，顷襄王怒而迁之。\n屈原至于江滨，被发行吟泽畔，颜色憔悴，形容枯槁。渔父见而问之曰：“子非三闾大夫欤？何故而至此？”屈原曰：“举世混浊而我独清，众人皆醉而我独醒，是以见放。”渔父曰：“夫圣人者，不凝滞于物，而能与世推移。举世混浊，何不随其流而扬其波？众人皆醉，何不其糟而啜其醨？何故怀瑾握瑜，而自令见放为？”屈原曰：“吾闻之，新沐者必弹冠，新浴者必振衣。人又谁能以身之察察，受物之汶汶者乎？宁赴常流而葬乎江鱼腹中耳，又安能以晧晧之白，而蒙世俗之温蠖乎？”乃作《怀沙》之赋。......于是怀石，遂自投汨罗以死。\n屈原既死之后，楚有宋玉、唐勒、景差之徒者，皆好辞而以赋见称；然皆祖屈原之从容辞令，终莫敢直谏。其后楚日以削，数十年，竟为秦所灭......。\n太史公曰：“余读《离骚》《天问》《招魂》《哀郢》，悲其志。适长沙，观屈原所自沉渊，未尝不垂涕，想见其为人。及见贾生吊之，又怪屈原以彼其材，游诸侯，何国不容，而自令若是！读《服鸟赋》，同死生，轻去就，又爽然自失矣。”",

"title":"Chemical versus Organic Farming",
"lastPosi":0.11489134714787738,
"text":"Chemical pesticides and artificial fertilisers have been in widespread use in farming since the middle of the 20th century. When they were first introduced, many farmers welcomed them as a great way to fight crop disease and increase production. Over time, however, what some scientists have found is that their long-term use can sometimes harm both the land and people’s health.\nFor example, pesticides can damage the land by killing not only harmful bacteria and insects, but also helpful ones. In addition, these chemicals can stay in the soil and underground water sources for a long time. This affects the crops grown on the land and, in turn, the animals and humans who digest them. Many people worry that these chemicals may make them ill and even cause cancer. In fact, some pesticides like DDT have been prohibited in most countries because of the damage they cause to people and the environment. As for chemical fertilisers, crops grown with them usually grow too fast to be rich in nutrition. They may look beautiful on the outside, but inside there is usually more water than essential minerals, and they often have less flavour as well.\nAs an alternative, some farmers have switched to organic farming, and many customers have turned to organic food when they shop at the local grocery. Organic farming is simply farming without using any chemicals. Organic farmers focus on keeping their soil rich and free of disease through natural means. For example, many organic farmers use natural waste from animals as fertiliser. This makes the soil in their fields richer in minerals. It also keeps the air, soil, water, and crops free of chemicals.\nOrganic farmers also use many other methods to produce rich soil. They often change the kind of crop grown in each field every year. For instance, they may grow corn or wheat in a field one year, and then grow beans there the next. Why different crops are grown is because they put important minerals back into the ground, making it ready for the next batch of crops. Organic farmers also plant diverse crops that use different depths of soil to help keep it rich. For example, peanuts grow on the ground’s surface, but many other vegetables put down deep roots. The goal of using different organic farming methods is to grow good food while avoiding damage to the environment or to people’s health.\nSome people would prefer to stop the use of man-made chemicals in agriculture entirely. What keeps them from doing so is the fact that chemical farming serves the high demand for food around the world. Organic farming is nowhere near able to meet that need. Therefore, there is still a long way to find a suitable solution that puts sufficient food on the dinner table while keeping people and the environment as healthy as possible.",

"title":"Listening to How Bodies Talk",

"text":"We use both words and body language to express our thoughts and opinions in our interactions with other people. We can learn a lot about what people are thinking by watching their body language. Words are important, but the way people stand, hold their arms, and move their hands can also give us information about their feelings.\nJust like spoken language, body language varies from culture to culture. The crucial thing is using body language in a way that is appropriate to the culture you are in. For example, making eye contact—looking into someone’s eyes—in some countries is a way to display interest. In other countries, by contrast, eye contact is not always approved of. For example, in many Middle Eastern countries, men and women are not socially permitted to make eye contact. In Japan, it may demonstrate respect to look down when talking to an older person.\nThe gesture for “OK” has different meanings in different cultures. In Japan, someone who witnesses another person employing the gesture might think it means money. In France, a person encountering an identical gesture may interpret it as meaning zero. However, you should avoid making this gesture in Brazil and Germany, as it is not considered polite.\nEven the gestures we use for “yes” and “no” differ around the world. In many countries, shaking one’s head means “no”, and nodding means “yes”. By comparison, in Bulgaria and southern Albania, the gestures have the opposite meaning. There are also differences in how we touch each other, how close we stand to someone we are talking to, and how we act when we meet or part. In countries like France and Russia, people may kiss their friends  on the cheek when they meet. Elsewhere, people favour  shaking hands, bowing from the waist, or nodding the head when they meet someone else.\nSome gestures seem to have the same meaning everywhere. Placing your hands together and resting them on the side of your head while closing your eyes means “sleep”. A good way of saying “I am full” is moving your hand in circles over your stomach after a meal.\nSome body language has many different uses. Perhaps the best example is smiling. A smile can help us get through difficult situations and find friends in a world of strangers. A smile can break down barriers. We can use a smile to apologise, to greet someone, to ask for help, or to start a conversation. Experts suggest smiling at yourself in the mirror to make yourself feel happier and stronger. And if we are feeling down or lonely, there is nothing better than seeing the smiling face of a good friend.",

"text":"Have you ever forgotten to lock the door of your house? Or, have you ever forgotten to switch off the TV or computer? These kinds of things happen to us all the time, waste resources, and can sometimes lead to problems. However, in the not-too-distant future, we will be living in smart homes that will lock the door for us when we are away and remember to switch off the TV when we forget. These smart homes will keep us secure, save us energy, and provide a more comfortable environment to live in.\n## Intelligent Controls\nToday, we have to use switches for our lights, knobs for our appliances, and remote controls for our TVs and air conditioners. In the future, we will be using advanced technology every day for automatic control of just about everything in our home. The future home will use integrated sensors to tell when you leave home each morning, and then go into an energy-efficient mode all by itself. You will no longer have to think about turning switches on and off yourself. Your home will also learn your daily routine and preferences, so everything will be ready for you when you get home each evening. Your lights will come on the instant you enter the door along with your favourite music or TV programmes, and you will find your dinner already prepared for you. All controls will respond to voice commands, so if you want to change your routine, you just say aloud what you want and the home system will obey.\n## Regular Health Checks\nIn addition, your smart home will be monitoring your health for you every day.\nYour bed, for example, will record how well you sleep every night. It will also be checking your body weight. If you start to have sleep or weight problems, it will send a warning to your phone. It will also give you suggestions on a healthier diet and how to sleep better. Smart toilets will be keeping constant track of your health as well. They can warn you early on if there is something abnormal or if you have a critical illness, such as cancer, and potentially save your life.\n## No More Disasters\nSmart homes will be able to prevent serious damage from accidents. For example, if a water pipe starts leaking, or if there is a short in the electrical wiring, your smart home will detect it and provide you with the relevant information. This way, you will be able to fix the problem before your home becomes flooded or catches fire.\nThis smart technology is not a fantasy. Many of these new innovations are already available and being used in some homes. In this sense, the home of tomorrow is already the home of today. Nevertheless, it will take some years before most new homes begin to use this new technology.",

"text":"Yuan Longping, known as the “father of hybrid rice”, was one of China’s most famous scientists. Yet, he considered himself a farmer because he continually worked the land in his research. Indeed, his slim but strong body was just like that of millions of Chinese farmers, to whom he had devoted his life.\nYuan Longping was born in 1930 in Beijing. His parents wanted him to pursue a career in science or medicine. However, what concerned him most was that farmers often had poor harvests and sometimes even had a serious shortage of food to eat. To tackle this crisis, he chose to study agriculture and received an education at Southwest Agricultural College in Chongqing.\nAfter graduating in 1953, he worked as a researcher. Yuan Longping realised that larger fields were not the solution. Instead, farmers needed to boost yields in the fields they had. How this could be done was a challenging question at the time. Yuan was convinced that the answer could be found in the creation of hybrid rice. A hybrid is a cross between two or more varieties of a species. One characteristic of hybrids is that they usually attain a higher yield than conventional crops. However, whether it was possible to develop a hybrid of self-pollinating plants such as rice was a matter of great debate. The common assumption then was that it could not be done. Through intense effort, Yuan overcame enormous technical difficulties to develop the first hybrid rice that could be used for farming in 1974. This hybrid enabled farmers to expand their output greatly.\nToday, it is estimated that about 60 percent of domestic rice consumption in China is comprised of crops generated from Yuan’s hybrid strains, and his strains have allowed China’s farmers to produce around 200 million tons of rice per year. Yuan’s innovation has helped feed not just China, but many other countries that depend on rice as well, such as India and Vietnam. Because of his invaluable contributions, Yuan Longping received numerous awards both in China and abroad.\nGiven that Yuan’s hybrids made him quite wealthy, one might think he would have retired to a life of leisure. However, this is far from the case. Deep down, Yuan was still very much a farmer at heart. As a man of the soil, he cared little for celebrity or money. Instead, he made large donations to support agricultural research.\nWhat impressed people most about Yuan Longping was his ongoing ability to fulfil his dreams. Long ago, he envisioned rice plants as tall as sorghum, with each ear of rice as big as a broom, and each grain of rice as huge as a peanut. He succeeded in producing a kind of rice that could feed more people at home and abroad. His later vision for “seawater rice” also became a reality, and potentially opened up nearly one million square kilometres of salty land in China for rice production. Even in his later years, Yuan Longping was still young at heart and full of vision, and everyone was always excited to see what he would dream up next.",

"text":"Albert Einstein, who is perhaps the greatest scientist in modern physics, is often considered one of the smartest men who ever lived. He made numerous contributions to the world, the most well-known being the general theory of relativity and the famous formula E=mc². Einstein was not only a genius; he was a courageous and kind figure loved by many people.\n\nThis gentle genius was born in Germany on 14 March 1879. When he was 16, he tried to enter university in Switzerland, but failed due to his low scores in the general part of the entrance exam, despite obtaining exceptional scores in maths and physics. After studying for another year, he managed to pass the exam, entering university in 1896 and graduating in 1900.\n\nAfter two years of looking for work as a teacher, Einstein took a job as a clerk in the Swiss patent office. While working there, out of a strong passion for knowledge, he continued to study, earning a doctorate in physics in 1905. That same year, which was later recorded as a miracle year in science, he published four extraordinary physics papers. Following this, he gradually became famous throughout the world as the new Isaac Newton. After four years, he was able to quit his job at the patent office and enter research full-time at a university. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics for his explanation of the photoelectric effect.\n\nCircumstances changed in 1933, when Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, who was Jewish, found the doors of academic institutions closed to him. As a consequence, he had to flee Germany. After spending time in Europe, he finally took up a position as a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, USA. Following that, he continued to make great achievements in physics and mathematics.\n\nTo the public, he was seen as a slightly odd-looking but kind and funny man. He had a thick moustache and long white hair, which sometimes stood on end as though he had just received an electric shock. Although he was a genius, he sometimes forgot things, like his friends’ birthdays. But despite his peculiarities, he was loved by his friends and neighbours. There is even a story about how he helped a little girl who knocked on his door and asked for help with her homework. In fact, Einstein often encountered people on the street who would stop him and ask him to help explain things. After many such occasions, he finally started saying, “Pardon me! Sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein!”\n\nOn 18 April 1955, it was reported that Einstein had passed away, and the whole world mourned the great loss of a brilliant scientist.",

"title":"How Do I Know My Students?",
"lastPosi":0.9202410492733073,
"text":"As an educator, people often ask me how I know what is going on in the minds of my students. Many students are quite shy and don’t speak all that much. At the same time, in a classroom of more than forty students, it is hard to have many one-on-one conversations with each person. So, how can I really know what makes each student tick?\nMy answer? I look at their body language.\nIt is easy to recognise when students are interested in a lesson. Most tend to look up and make eye contact. When I make a joke, they smile. When I talk about something difficult, they look confused. I know when students are really interested, however, because they lean forward and look at me. People have a tendency to lean towards whatever they are interested in. So if a student has his head lowered to look at his watch, it implies he is bored and just counting the minutes for the class to end. If two friends are leaning their heads together, they are probably writing notes to each other. Of course, not everyone who looks up is paying attention in class.\nSome students look up, but there is an absence of eye contact. Their eyes barely move, and they always have the same distant expression on their faces. It is as though they are asleep with their eyes open.\nSome students are amused by something else. They spend all their time looking anywhere but at me. Then again, some students’ favourite activity is daydreaming. With their chins on their hands, they occupy themselves by staring out of the window or up at the ceiling. They are certainly interested in something, but who knows what. The main thing is reminding distracted students that they need to pay attention in class.\nWhile it is easy to perceive when students are interested, bored, or distracted, it is sometimes much harder to distinguish when students are troubled. Students who are angry, afraid, or experiencing anxiety may have their arms crossed in front of their chests and their legs closed or crossed, like they are guarding their bodies. Students who are sad or worried will nearly always wear a frown. They may also hide their faces in their hands like they are embarrassed or ashamed. Some students act this way merely because they are afraid of being called on by the teacher. However, if a student does not bother to brush her hair and her eyes are red from weeping, then I can infer that there are deeper issues at work. It could be that she is having serious conflicts with other students or at home. Whatever it is, I know I need to inquire and assess what is going on.\nUltimately, my duty is helping every student to learn. Their body language lets me know when to adjust class activities, when to intervene, and when to talk to students individually, so they can all get the most out of school. Reacting to body language is an important component of being a teacher.",

"text":"## A Summer Where the Sun Never Sleeps\nI wake up to the sound of the wind buffeting the cloth of my tent. Even though the sun is brightly shining, telling whether it is morning or night is impossible. Iʼm above the Arctic Circle, where in summer the sun never sets. Checking my watch, I see that it is 7:30 a.m. I leave my tent and walk over to the mountain edge. Spreading out before me, branches of the Rapa River flow through the valley below. I’m in the remote far north of Sweden in Sarek National Park, a place with no roads or towns.\n## A Land of Mountains and Ice\nSarek’s mountains used to be covered by vast sheets of ice. Around 9,000 years ago, this ice melted, leaving behind about 100 glaciers. Soon after, reindeer began to arrive. Following the reindeer were the Sami people, who made this territory their home. Getting here is quite difficult, so apart from the Sami very few people have ever seen Sarek. In 1909, Sarek was made a national park in order to keep the land in its natural state. Though the Sami are allowed to continue their traditional way of life in the park, no one else can live here, and all new development is banned within park boundaries. At the far side of the valley, an ancient Sami cottage is visible. Close by, there are a few reindeer feeding on grass.\n## Man at Peace with Nature\nFor hundreds of years, looking after reindeer was a way of life for the Sami. They used the reindeer’s meat for food, their bones for tools, and their skin for making clothes and tents. Since reindeer were always on the move, the Sami would pick up their tents and accompany them. Today, most Sami have houses in villages near Sarek and live a modern life just like their neighbours. But every spring, a small number of Sami still follow their reindeer into the valleys of Sarek, living in tents or old cottages and enjoying their traditions. I am not a Sami, but in Sarek I’ve adopted some of their habits. For example, this morning my breakfast is flat bread warmed over a fire, dried reindeer meat, and some sweet and sour berries that I found growing near my tent.\n## A Land of Adventure\nAfter breakfast, I pack my bag and set out again. Since I must carry all of my food and supplies with me, my bag weighs about 30 kilograms. If today is anything like yesterday, it will be full of sweat and hard work as I hike over this difficult land to my destination on the other side of the valley. However, I cannot complain. Being in such a beautiful and wild place makes me feel blessed to be alive. Here I am, alone under this broad sky, breathing the fresh air, and enjoying this great adventure. What could be better?",

"text":"6 October 2015\n\nThis year’s Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded to Tu Youyou (co-winner), whose research led to the discovery of artemisinin, a crucial new treatment for malaria. Artemisinin has saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and has led to improved health for millions of people. Over 200 million people around the world get malaria each year, and about 600,000 die from it. Artemisinin has become a vital part of the treatment for malaria, and is thought to save 100,000 lives a year in Africa alone.\n\nTu Youyou, a committed and patient scientist, was born in Ningbo, China, on 30 December 1930, and graduated from Peking University Medical School in 1955. After she graduated, she worked at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing. In 1967, the Chinese government formed a team of scientists with the objective of discovering a new treatment for malaria, and Tu Youyou was among the first researchers chosen. In the beginning, Tu Youyou went to Hainan, where malaria was more common, to study malaria patients. In 1969, she became the head of the project in Beijing, and decided to review ancient Chinese medical texts to find traditional botanical treatments for the disease. Her team examined over 2,000 old medical texts, and evaluated 280,000 plants for their medical properties. From their research, they discovered and tested 380 distinct ancient Chinese medical treatments that showed promise in the fight against malaria.\n\nOne medical text from the fourth century suggested using the extract from sweet wormwood to treat a fever. Tu’s team tested a collection of dried wormwood leaves but found no effect. They then tried boiling fresh wormwood, and using the liquid obtained from this to treat malaria, but this did not work either. Their project got stuck. However, Tu Youyou would not acknowledge defeat. She analysed the medical texts again, and by chance, she found one sentence suggesting a different way to treat the wormwood. She concluded that boiling the sweet wormwood apparently destroyed its medical properties.\n\nUsing a lower temperature to draw out the extract, she found a substance that worked. After failing more than 190 times, the team finally succeeded in 1971. Tu Youyou and her team members even insisted on testing the medicine on themselves to make sure that it was safe. Later, the medicine was tested on malaria patients, most of whom recovered. This medicine, which was called artemisinin, soon became a standard treatment for malaria.\n\nAccording to Tu Youyou, the discovery of artemisinin was a team effort. Upon hearing that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize, she said, “The honour is not just mine. There is a team behind me, and all the people of my country. This success proves the great value of traditional Chinese medicine. It is indeed an honour for China’s scientific research and Chinese medicine to be spread around the world.”\n",

"title":"Should We Fight New Technology?",
"lastPosi":0.751270460045856,
"text":"This morning, I saw the shocking headline: “Passenger Dies When Car Crashes in Driverless Mode”. In the article, various people said that the public should oppose the idea of developing driverless cars. They said that some advances in technology were unnecessary and could even be dangerous. Hence, we should cease accepting technology just because it is new. The newspaper reported that the car company had already apologised for the accident, but the families of the deceased said it was not enough. Nevertheless, the company still claimed that most people would be travelling in driverless cars one day soon.\nOn the one hand, there are many different groups of people around the world who live happily in the absence of new technology. Probably the most well-known are the Amish, a group of Christians living in rural America. They do not own or drive cars, watch TV, or use the Internet. They have lived mainly as farmers since the 18th century, and they will probably be living the same way in the distant future. They advocate a simple life with an emphasis on hard work, family, and community. They think that is better than caring about luxuries or following the lives of the rich and famous. It could even be argued that the Amish’s quality of life is better since they live in and appreciate the natural environment rather than living in large, polluted cities.\nOn the other hand, new technology has provided people everywhere with many benefits over the years. For example, the latest weather-tracking computer programmes give people lots of warnings about potential natural disasters, which saves many lives. Moreover, the Internet has made it possible for friends and family to keep in touch easily even if they are on opposite sides of the world. It has also made finding opportunities in life much easier, as it allows people to make larger networks of friends through using social media.\nPersonally, I have benefited quite a lot from technological advances. I found my career as an AI designer through a social media network. My health monitor, which I wear all the time, has also helped me get into the best shape of my life. Of course, when new technology changes the way we live, it can be a scary prospect. Nevertheless, I will always look on the positive side of change and accept it rather than resist it.",

"title":"John Snow Defeats “King Cholera”",
"lastPosi":0.7966337358477541,
"text":"Cholera used to be one of the most feared diseases in the world, until a British doctor, John Snow, showed how it could be overcome. This illness causes severe diarrhoea, dehydration, and even death. In the early 19th century, when an outbreak of cholera hit Europe, millions of people died from the disease. As a young doctor, John Snow became frustrated because no one knew how to prevent or treat cholera. In time, he rose to become a famous doctor, and even attended to Queen Victoria when she gave birth. However, he never lost his desire to destroy cholera once and for all.\nIn general, doctors in those days had two contradictory theories to explain how cholera spread. One theory was that bad air caused the disease. The other was that cholera was caused by an infection from germs in food or water. Snow subscribed to the second theory. It was correct, but he still needed proof. Consequently, when an outbreak of cholera hit London in 1854, Snow began to investigate. He discovered that in two particular streets the cholera outbreak was so severe that more than 500 people died in ten days. He was determined to find out why.\nSnow began by marking on a map the exact places where all those who died had lived. There were multiple deaths near the water pump in Broad Street (especially house numbers 16, 37, 38, and 40). However, some households (such as 20 and 21 Broad Street, and 8 and 9 Cambridge Street) had had no deaths. These people worked in the pub at 7 Cambridge Street. They had been given free beer, and so had not drunk the water from the pump. Snow suspected that the water pump was to blame. What is more, in another part of London, a woman and her daughter had died of cholera after moving away from Broad Street. It seemed that the woman liked the water from the pump so much that she had it delivered to her house every day. As a result of this evidence, John Snow was able to announce that the pump water carried cholera germs. Accordingly, he had the handle of the pump removed so that it could not be used. Through this intervention, the disease was stopped in its tracks.\nThe truth was that the water from the Broad Street pump had been infected by waste. Moreover, Snow was later able to show a link between other cases of cholera and the different water companies in London. Some companies sold water from the River Thames that was polluted by raw waste. The people who drank this water were much more likely to get cholera than those who drank pure or boiled water.\nThrough Snow’s tireless efforts, water companies began to sell clean water, and the threat of cholera around the world saw a substantial decrease. However, cholera is still a problem. Each year, millions of people around the world get cholera and many die from it. Fortunately, we now know how to prevent cholera, thanks to the work of John Snow. Moreover, in his use of maps and statistics, Snow transformed the way scientists study diseases. For this reason, Snow is considered the father of modern epidemiology.",

"lastPosi":0.45192967204098106,
"text":"## Letter Ⅰ\nDear Editor,\nIn the past few decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people studying abroad. Although studying abroad can bring great benefits, I think the disadvantages for young people are greater.\nTo begin with, many students who study abroad face great economic pressure. That means studying abroad is just not possible for everyone. Tuition fees and living expenses are much more expensive than at home and could end up costing most families an arm and a leg. Studying in China is much more convenient and can help save money.\nAnother important factor to consider is the tremendous pressure that comes with studying abroad. Students must learn how to live in an unfamiliar environment with limited language skills. Some may struggle and suffer from culture shock when learning how to behave in new surroundings. Other students are not mature enough to handle the challenges by themselves and may become depressed. Some students might even encounter problems with personal safety. In addition, different approaches to teaching and learning may come as a shock to many students.\nA final point to consider is that while studying abroad does have potential benefits, young people who study in China also have a great future to look forward to! As China has boomed, the educational environment has improved significantly, with many great universities now available. They have great facilities and outstanding professors, helping to educate young people who will contribute to the economy and further strengthen our country.\nTo sum up, one cannot deny the fact that studying abroad has its disadvantages, so when you think about studying abroad, you should consider these many factors.\nKind regards,\nWang Li (mother of twin girls)\n\n## Letter Ⅱ\nDear Editor,\nIs studying abroad a good idea or not? There are certainly disadvantages, but in my opinion, the advantages are much greater. As I always tell my son, there are no great difficulties for a person who is brave, optimistic, and willing to work hard!\nThe first advantage of studying abroad is personal growth. The education you gain and the experiences you have will change you for the better. For example, you will certainly become more independent because you will have to deal with all kinds of difficulties by yourself. Studying abroad also helps you to gain a global perspective and improve your general competence.\nAnother advantage is the increased chance for cultural exchange. Chinese students can be seen as cultural envoys promoting friendship between nations. International students in China also bring their colourful cultures here. Cooperating with people from diverse cultural backgrounds helps us view the world from different angles and thus gives us more insight into our own culture.\nFinally, studying abroad provides a great opportunity to contribute to the development of our motherland. China’s global outlook, with projects such as the Belt and Road Initiative, has helped us make connections across the world. Therefore, China needs more talented young people with a global perspective who are highly competent with languages, have leadership and organisational skills, and have strong cultural awareness. Students who study abroad will develop such skills and abilities, and these in turn will provide them with better career opportunities.\nAll in all, studying abroad helps to build character and increase people’s understanding of cultural diversity while strengthening China and building a shared future for all. I think this life-changing experience is certainly worthwhile, and I hope my child will study abroad in the future.\nSincerely yours,\nZhang Yi (father of one boy)",

However, Brillat-Savarin was actually referring to our personality, character, and culture.\nCertainly, in many ways this seems to be true. Chinese cuisine is a case in point. Prior to coming to China, my only experience with Chinese cooking was in America, with Chinese food that had been changed to suit American tastes. For example, America’s most popular Chinese dish is General Tso’s chicken, which consists of fried chicken covered in a sweet sauce, flavoured with hot red peppers. This is probably not an authentic Chinese recipe, however, so it cannot tell us much about the Chinese. On the other hand, it does tell us a lot about Americans. It tells us, for example, that Americans love bold, simple flavours. And, since the dish was also invented recently, it tells us that Americans are not afraid to try new foods.\nLater, I had a chance to experience authentic Chinese food by coming to China. When my family and I had just arrived in China, we went looking for a good place to eat in Beijing. A Sichuan restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend, and finally, we found it. Tired, hungry, and not knowing a word of Chinese, we had no idea how to order, so the chef just began filling our table with the best food we had ever eaten. With this, we had the pleasure of experiencing an entirely new taste: Sichuan peppercorns. The food was wonderful and different, but what was even more important was the friendship offered us.\nWe soon moved to Shandong Province in the eastern part of North China. My favourite dish there was boiled dumplings served with vinegar. I observed that family is important to the people there. It has become a favourite traditional dish of the people in North China, where making dumplings has always been a family affair with everyone—from the youngest to the oldest—joining in to help. Later, I learnt that the most famous food in Shandong is pancake rolls stuffed with sliced Chinese green onions.\nThen we moved to northern Xinjiang. Some of our friends were Kazak and Inner Mongolian. These groups traditionally wandered the open range on horses. As a result, their traditional foods are what you can cook over an open fire—usually boiled or roasted meat, such as lamb kebab.\nOur travels then took us to South China, and then on to central China. In each place we went, we experienced wonderful local dishes, from Guangdong’s elegant dim sum—small servings of food in bamboo steamers—to the exceptional stewed noodles in Henan. Everywhere, the food was as varied as the people. However, one thing is always true: Through food, Chinese people everywhere show friendship and kindness.\nAt a minimum, the kinds of food local people consume tell us what they grow in their region, what kinds of lives they lead, and what they like and do not like. Could we also say, for example, that those who like bold flavours are bold themselves? Or, that those who like spicy food tend to have a hot temper? Maybe. Maybe not. What we can say, however, is that culture and cuisine go hand in hand, and if you do not experience one, you can never really know the other.",

"text":"Stephen Hawking was one of the most famous and gifted scientists in physics. Most people are familiar with images of him in his wheelchair, unable to move and using a computer to talk. Since he came down with a disease which caused him to lose the use of most of his muscles, his world became one of abstract thought.\nHawking first achieved fame when he was still healthy enough to walk, as a graduate student in physics at Cambridge University in 1964. In general, there were two main theories on the origin of the universe. The first was the steady state theory, which holds that the universe has no beginning or end. The other was the big bang theory, which holds that the universe began at a single point in time and space. The biggest champion of the steady state concept was Fred Hoyle, a professor at Cambridge. During the question and answer period after one of Hoyle’s lectures, Hawking stood up and pointed out that Hoyle had made a mistake in his maths. Once the maths was corrected, it showed that the big bang theory—and not the steady state theory— was true. Hawking’s own work on the big bang theory was soon proven by astronomers with telescopes. A star was born.\nSo, what made Stephen Hawking a genius? Besides being brilliant, he was brave, though sometimes careless in what he said or did. He was willing to say what others were afraid to say, and to dream of what others were afraid to dream about. Furthermore, he was quite determined. This had helped him as a scientist, and had helped him even more in his fight against his disease. Above all, Hawking was willing to admit his faults. This odd combination of characteristics had made him one of the greatest thinkers of the 20th and 21st centuries.",

"title":"Healthy Eating",
"lastPosi":0.6834061135371179,
"text":"There is much debate nowadays as to what makes up a healthy diet. For example, scientists have insisted for years that a big enemy of health is fatty food. However, there is increasing evidence that the real driver of poor health is not so much fatty food, as it is sugar. Heart disease is the number one killer of Americans. And in America, people who receive 25% of their daily calories or more through sugar are twice as likely to die from heart disease than people who receive less than 10% a day (Journal of the American Medical Association, 2014). This is true regardless of how healthy the rest of their diet might be. Put more simply, while people continue to argue over whether or not fatty food is dangerous, we already know that sugar is a killer.\nMuch of this extra sugar comes from sweets and sweet drinks. The average American gets 1/3 of his or her sugar through sweet drinks alone. The American Heart Association recommends that we limit ourselves to less than 100–150 calories a day from sugar, which is less than what is usually contained in one can of sweet drink or in a single candy bar. In other words, if you want to be healthy, you have to cut down on desserts, and cut out sweet drinks altogether.\nBeyond this, you can keep healthy by consuming different categories of fresh foods, especially fruit and vegetables, which are full of vitamins and fibre, rather than processed foods. Processed foods often contain less nutrition, and have higher quantities of sugar, salt, and fat than fresh ingredients. Besides this, it is also important to have some meat, beans, or dairy products in your diet, as they provide the necessary protein for strong bones and muscle growth. As with everything in life, moderation is key. The ideal diet is a balanced one, without too much or too little of any one thing.\nFinally, a fundamental key to healthy eating is to eat slowly. It takes about twenty minutes from the time you start eating for your brain to tell your body that you are full. What this means is that people who chew too quickly end up eating too much food because they still feel hungry. Eating slowly also allows your body to digest your food better, and will allow you to enjoy your food more. In addition, studies show that consistent eating habits, for example, taking three meals a day at the same time each day, are better for our health. It is also better to eat a modest amount of food each time, rather than to eat a lot in one meal, and then a little in the next.\nThere is no one trick to healthy eating. Rather, healthy eating starts with having a healthy attitude towards food. One question you can ask yourself is, “Do I eat to live, or live to eat?” If you are using food mostly for nutrition, then you are on the right track with your diet. However, if food has become the centre of your life, you might be on the road to bad health. It is up to you to decide how you want to live, and to make the right decisions about your diet.",

"title":"First Aid for Burns",
"lastPosi":0.7830596369922213,
"text":"The skin is an essential part of your body and is its largest organ. Your skin acts as a barrier against disease, toxins, and the sun’s rays. It also helps control your body temperature, prevents your body from losing too much water, warns you when things are too hot or cold, and gives you your sense of touch. As you can imagine, getting burnt can lead to very serious injuries. The first and most important step in the treatment of burns is giving first aid.\n## CAUSES OF BURNS\nYou can get burnt by a variety of things: hot liquids, steam, fire, radiation, the sun, electricity, acids, or other chemicals.\n## TYPES OF BURNS\nBurns are divided into three types, depending on the depth of skin damage.\n\n• First-degree burns: These affect only the top few millimetres of the skin. These burns are not serious. Examples include mild sunburn and burns caused by other minor household incidents.\n• Second-degree burns: These go below the top layer of the skin. They are serious and take a few weeks to get better. Examples include burns caused by hot liquids.\n• Third-degree burns: These affect every layer of the skin, and sometimes the tissue under it. Examples include burns caused by electric shocks, burning clothes, or petrol fires. These burns cause very severe internal injuries and the victim must go to the hospital at once.\n## CHARACTERISTICS OF BURNS\n### First-degree burns\n• dry, red, and mildly swollen\n• mildly painful\n• turn white when pressed\n### Second-degree burns\n• red and swollen; blisters; watery surface\n• extremely painful\n### Third-degree burns\n• black and white \n• swollen; the tissue underneath can often be seen\n• little or no pain if nerves are damaged; may be painful around the edges of the burn\n\n## FIRST-AID TREATMENT\n1 Place burns under cool running water, especially within the first ten minutes. The cool water stops the burning process and reduces the pain and swelling.\n2 Dry the burnt area gently with a clean cloth.\n3 Remove any clothes using scissors if necessary, unless you see the fabric sticking to the burnt skin.\n4 Cover the burnt area with a loose clean cloth. Applying oil to the injured areas is a bad idea, as it will keep the heat in the wounds and may cause infection.\n5 If burns are on the face, make sure the victim can still breathe.\n6 If the victim is suffering from second or third-degree burns, there is an urgent need to take him/her to the hospital at once.",

"text":"After Li Daiyu and her cousin arrived in Toronto, the largest and wealthiest city in Canada, they only had a few hours to kill before they had to proceed to the next leg of their trip to Montreal, so they went on a tour of the city. They went up the CN Tower and looked across the shores of Lake Ontario. Standing in the distance, they were astonished to see misty clouds rising from the great Niagara Falls, which is on the south side of the lake. Water from the lake flows into the Niagara River and over the falls on its way to the sea.\nThe girls saw hundreds of skyscrapers of glass and steel, and old-fashioned cars rolling by. As they walked north from the harbour area, Li Daiyu said, “Lin Fei, one of my mother’s old schoolmates, lives here. I should phone her and see if she’s available for dinner.”\nThey met Lin Fei around dusk over dinner at a restaurant in downtown Chinatown. The cousins chatted with Lin Fei, who had moved to Canada many years earlier.\n“This is the largest Chinatown in Toronto. We have a few more in the Greater Toronto Area, so you can guess that there are a lot of Chinese people in Canada! Chinese people have been coming here for more than a hundred years. Therefore, we can get all kinds of great food here from all over China,” Lin Fei told them.\nThe train left late that night and arrived in Montreal early the next morning. At the station, in contrast to Toronto, they heard people talking in French. They were surprised to see that all the signs and advertisements were in French and many people spoke English with an accent.\n“We don’t leave until this evening,” said Liu Qian. “Let’s go downtown. Old Montreal is close to the water.”\nThey spent the afternoon in lovely shops and visiting artists in their workplaces along St Paul Street. As they sat in a restaurant alongside the broad St Lawrence River, a young man sat down with them.\n“Hello, my name is Jean-Philippe. I’m a photographer,” he said, “and I was wondering where you are from.”\nThe girls told him they were from China and were on a train trip across Canada. When they told him they had only one day in Montreal, he said, “That’s too bad. You owe it to yourselves to stay longer. Overall, Montreal is a city with wonderful sights and sounds. Most of us speak both English and French, and the city has unique Quebec culture and traditions. There are fantastic restaurants and clubs around, too. Here, we love good coffee, toast, and cheese. And good music, of course!”\nThat night the train was speeding along the St Lawrence River towards the Gulf of St Lawrence and down to the distant east coast towards the province of Nova Scotia and its largest city, Halifax. The cousins dreamt happily of the beautiful cobblestone streets, old brick buildings, and the red maple leaves of Montreal.",

I ask them to repeat themselves a lot!”\nAlthough some foreign students live in campus accommodation, Xie Lei chose to live with a host family, who can help with her adaptation to the new culture. “When I miss home, I feel comforted to have a second family,” Xie Lei said. “When there’s something I don’t know or understand, I can ask them. They are also keen to learn about China. Laura, the daughter of my host family, wants to study in China in the future. We take turns to cook each evening. They really love my stir-fried tomatoes and eggs! Laura says she always feels hungry when she smells it, so I taught her how to cook it, too.”\nAnother challenge for Xie Lei is the academic requirements. The first time that she had to write an essay, her tutor explained that she must acknowledge what other people had said if she cited their ideas, but that he mainly wanted to know what she thought! Xie Lei was confused because she thought she knew less than other people. Her tutor advised her to read lots of information in order to form a wise opinion of her own.\nXie Lei also found many courses included students’ participation in class as part of the final result. Students need to generate ideas, offer examples, apply concepts, and raise questions, as well as give presentations. At first, Xie Lei had no idea what she should say, but what surprised her was that she found herself speaking up in class after just a few weeks. “My presentation on traditional Chinese art was a great success, which boosted my confidence,” she said. “I’ll use these skills back home for presentations. They’ll help me build a strong business in the future.”\nNow halfway through her exchange year, Xie Lei feels much more at home in the UK. What seemed strange before now appears quite normal to her.“Engaging in British culture has helped,” she said.“As well as studying hard, I’ve been involved in social activities. British people are fascinated by our culture and eager to learn more about it, so I’m keen to share my culture with them. While I’m learning about business, I’m also acting as a cultural messenger building a bridge between us.”\nWe will follow Xie Lei’s progress in later editions, but for now, we wish her all the best.",

"title":"Story About Providing First Aid",
"lastPosi":0.8346245600878976,
"text":"Chen Wei, a high school student in Beijing, had his dinner interrupted when he heard someone screaming from another table. A fellow diner at the restaurant, Zhang Tao, was choking on some steak. He was now holding his throat with his face turning red, while his desperate friends were slapping him on the back.\nChen wasted no time. He got up and ran to Zhang’s table at once. With the help of Zhang’s friends, he was able to help Zhang to his feet. Then, standing behind Zhang, Chen did the Heimlich manoeuvre. The food was instantly forced out, and Zhang began to breathe again. Ten minutes later, an ambulance arrived. The doctors checked Zhang and made sure that he was fine. They suggested he eat more slowly and take smaller bites before they left.\nChoking victims usually have only about four minutes before they collapse and sometimes die, leaving no time for an ambulance to arrive. To solve this problem, in 1974, an American doctor, Henry Heimlich, created the Heimlich manoeuvre, saving thousands of lives around the world. Doing the Heimlich manoeuvre is quick, practical, and easy. It is so easy, in fact, that almost anyone can learn how.\nIf you see someone choking, first call the emergency services. Then, make sure that the victim is really choking: A choking person cannot speak. Slapping the victim’s back will often force out the obstruction. If this does not work, you can perform the Heimlich manoeuvre by standing behind him and wrapping your arms around his waist. Make a fist with one hand and place it in the upper part of his stomach. Grabbing your fist with your other hand tightly, push up and into his stomach in one motion. Continue doing this until the obstruction is forced out.\nDoing the Heimlich manoeuvre on a small child is not recommended, as you may hurt him. Instead, lay the child face down on your lap with the head lower than the rest of his body, and then give firm slaps to his upper back until he can breathe again.\nWith choking victims, every minute counts. You cannot just stand by and do nothing. Luckily, Chen had learnt how to give first aid in school. Seeing Zhang choking, he remained calm and reacted immediately. Chen later said about the incident, “How could I justify sitting there and doing nothing? We are all humans and we all have a responsibility to look after one another’s welfare.”",

"text":"Li Daiyu and her cousin Liu Qian went to Canada to visit their cousins in Halifax on the Atlantic coast. Rather than travel by commercial airline all the way, they decided to fly to Vancouver and then take whole the country train. For both of them, the thought of crossing the whole country by rail was of exciting.\nBefore starting out, they spent a couple of days in Vancouver, seeing the sights. During their first day, as is typical of Vancouver, it rained. Despite the weather, they were able to take a boat ride out into the bay, and later visit an island that had wonderful shops selling crafts and antiques. The next day was clear and mild, and they were pleased to see the beautiful mountains looking out over the city. Later, they took a pleasant hike in a forest just a short distance away.\nThe next morning, the two girls arose early to take the train to Lake Louise, passing through the Canadian Rockies. Seen from the train window, the mountains and forests of Canada looked massive. When the train arrived at the station, they took a taxi to Lake Louise, where the blue water literally took their breath away with its exceptional beauty. They spent the night, and then took a coach bound north through the Canadian Rockies to Jasper. Looking at the beautiful scenery, they both agreed that it was the most awesome journey they had ever taken. In addition to seeing spectacular mountain peaks and forests, one highlight of their trip was being able to see many different creatures, including deer, mountain goats, and even a grizzly bear and an eagle.\nFrom Jasper, they caught the train towards Toronto. One of the train’s first stops was in Edmonton, the provincial capital of Alberta, the centre of Canada’s huge oil and gas drilling industry. Edmonton is freezing cold in winter, with daily temperatures averaging -10 ̊C. Since it can be too cold to go outdoors, Edmonton is home to many shopping malls. In fact, one of the largest shopping malls in North America is in Edmonton.\nFrom Edmonton, the train headed southeast across the great Canadian Prairie. At school, Daiyu and Liu Qian had learnt that Canada’s population is only slightly over thirty-seven million. However, they did not anticipate seeing such an open country, and were truly amazed. They went through two wheat-growing provinces, where they saw a bunch of farms that covered a very large area.\nAfter another day on the train, eventually they were back in an urban area, the city of Winnipeg. From there, they travelled through the night, and woke up in Ontario—a land of forests and lakes. The train thundered on, through the rolling hills. The bushes and maple trees outside their windows were red, gold, and orange, and there was frost on the ground, confirming that autumn had arrived in Canada. Night came again, and the train turned south towards Toronto. When they woke up the next morning and pulled back the curtain, they could see the wide stretch of Lake Huron—one of the four Great Lakes on Ontario’s southern border. It was not until 9:30 a.m. that they finally reached the capital of Ontario, Toronto. All in all, their trip from Vancouver to Toronto had taken a duration of four days.",

"text":"\nPerhaps no other scientist has had a greater impact on China’s aerospace science than Qian Xuesen. Described by the authors of the Story of Qian Xuesen as a man with “great scientific thought and scientific spirit” who was patriotic and served his homeland with effort, achievement, and devotion, Qian was an extremely well-respected man.\nBorn in Shanghai in 1911, Qian attended schools in Beijing and then entered Shanghai Jiao Tong University to study Railway Mechanical Engineering. However, after the Songhu Battle broke out in 1932, Qian made the decision to switch his major to aviation because he realised that China needed its own powerful air force to protect and defend the country.\nQian went to the United States in 1935 to pursue his graduate studies. Over the course of the 1930s and 1940s, Qian became a pioneer in American jet and rocket technology. As a graduate assistant at the California Institute of Technology during the 1930s, Qian helped conduct important research into rocket propulsion, and in the 1940s, he and several other people founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, now one of NASA’s leading space-exploration centres.\nAfter overcoming some difficulties during his final few years in the US, Qian returned to China in 1955. He received a hero’s welcome from his homeland and was put in charge of not only developing China’s rocket science but also its space and missile programme. At that time, China was poor and its rocket science was undeveloped. No institute or university in China offered rocket science as a major, and there were no talents or experts in this field in China. Nevertheless, Qian did not let that discourage him from taking on the challenge. When asked “Can we Chinese possibly make missiles?”, his reply was a determined “Why not? We Chinese are able to make the same things that other people make.”\nUnder Qian’s leadership, China developed the Dongfeng missiles, followed by the first generation of Long March rockets. In 1970, China successfully launched its first man-made satellite, Dong Fang Hong I, from a Long March rocket. Because much of the technology behind the Shenzhou rockets can also be traced back to Qian’s research, Qian earned the name of “the father of China’s aerospace”.\nQian read a lot and was extremely knowledgeable, especially in the area of frontier science research. However, what might have made him such an outstanding and creative scientist was probably his strong interest in other things, such as music and drawing. His deep appreciation for art often gave him inspiration in his scientific research.\nOn 31 October 2009, the whole country was saddened by Qian’s death, and people honoured and remembered him in different ways.",

"text":"We watched as Shackleton and the boat sailed away from Elephant Island. It was easy to imagine the danger ahead of them. Would they ever return to find us? What might happen to them? What if they were delayed? We felt so alone and desperate. But it was not for long. There was nothing like a good dinner and some music to cheer us up.\nLife fell into a regular pattern. Staying alive took all our time and energy. For example, we needed water, and Elephant Island had none. We found that we could melt ice from the ocean and drink the water from it. But how could we make fire? There were no trees growing on Antarctica and no oil, so the only fuel we could use was animal fat. This gave off oily, black smoke, but it stayed burning even in strong winds.\nFood was also a problem, as we did not find any vegetables or fruit on the island. One of our group members, Lionel Greenstreet, noted in his diary about how bored he was with the meals: “The food now is pretty well all meat of sea creatures.” If it weren’t for sea animals, we would all starve. As a chef, it was my duty to cook, so I tried to vary the meals in whatever way I could. But it was difficult.\nWe had to be careful not to go outside too often, as the changing temperatures could make us ill. It was almost as dangerous to become too hot from wearing too many clothes as to become too cold from wearing too few. The sweat could freeze very quickly. Many of us also became ill from the black smoke of the animal fat we burnt for our fires. It damaged our eyes and burnt our lungs.\nThe twenty-two of us lived like this in the cold for four months. Our discipline and team spirit kept us optimistic and helped us deal with our fears in a positive and successful way. We also celebrated our birthdays, festivals, and even the times when we caught a sea animal. This was an episode in my life that I would never forget.\nWhen we were finally rescued, we felt such relief and joy that many of us could not hide our tears. We were at last free to go home to warm beds, good food, and the care of our family and friends. Our optimism and faith in Shackleton had helped us persevere in staying alive. And he paid us back by his commitment to save us from a slow but painful death.",

"title":"A Short History of Western Painting",
"lastPosi":0.8858213834236005,
"text":"What is Western art? It is hard to give a precise definition. As there have been so many different styles of Western art, it is impossible to describe them all in a short text. Perhaps the best way to understand Western art is to look at the development of Western painting over the centuries.\n## The Middle Ages (from the 5th to the 15th century)\nDuring the Middle Ages, the purpose of Western art was to teach people about Christianity. Thus, artists were not interested in painting realistic scenes. Their works were often primitive and two-dimensional, and the main characters were often made much larger than everyone else to show their importance. This began to change in the 13th century with Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337). While his paintings still had religious themes, they showed real people in a real environment. In particular, his paintings are set apart from other paintings by their realistic human faces and deep emotional impact.\n## The Renaissance (from the 14th to the 17th century)\nNew ideas and values gradually replaced old ones from the Middle Ages. As a result, painters concentrated less on religious themes. They began to adopt a more humanistic attitude to life. An important breakthrough during this period was the use of perspective by Masaccio (1401–1428). Influential painters such as Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), Michelangelo (1475–1564), and Raphael (1483–1520) built upon Giotto and Masaccio’s innovations to produce some of the greatest art that Europe had ever seen.\nAnother innovation was the use of oil paints. With their deep colours and realism, some of the best oil paintings look like photographs. While painters as early as Da Vinci had used oil, this technique reached its height with Rembrandt (1606–1669), who gained a reputation as a master of shadow and light.\nIn subject matter, the emphasis increasingly shifted from religious themes to people and the world around us. Kings, nobles, and people of high rank wanted to purchase accurate pictures of themselves and the people they loved. Others wanted paintings showing important historical events or stories from mythology. Finally, most clients wanted paintings that were beautiful and interesting to look at.\n## Impressionism (late 19th to early 20th century)\nThe development of Western art slowed until the invention of photography in the mid-19th century. After that, paintings were no longer needed to preserve what people and the world looked like. Hence, painters had to find a new way of looking at their art. From this, Impressionism emerged in France. The name of this new movement came from the painting by Claude Monet (1840–1926) called Impression, Sunrise. In this work, Monet’s aim was to convey the light and movement in the scene—the subjective impression the scene gave him—but not a detailed record of the scene itself.\nWhile many Impressionists painted scenes of nature or daily life, others, such as Renoir (1841– 1919), focused on people. Unlike the cold, black-and-white photographs of that time period, Renoir’s paintings are full of light, shadow, colour, and life. He sought to show not just the outer image of his subjects, but their inner warmth and humanity as well.\n## Modern Art (from the 20th century to today)\nAfter Impressionism, subsequent artists began to ask, “What do we do next?” Painters such as Picasso (1881–1973) tried to analyse the shapes which existed in the natural world but in a new way, with Cubism. Others gave their paintings a realistic but dream-like quality. Still others turned to abstract art. What they attempted to do was no longer show reality, but instead to ask the question, “What is art?”",

"text":"The Richfield Museum of Fine Art is proud to present our new exhibition, “From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages.” Join us as we explore more than 3,000 years of wonderful art from the Middle Kingdom. From bronze bowls to ceramic vases, and jade sculptures to ink wash paintings, our goal is to display the Chinese artistic genius from ancient times.\nThe highlight of this exhibition is the painting Clearing After Snow on a Mountain Pass, one of the great works of Tang Yin (1470–1524). Born during the Ming Dynasty, Tang sought and failed to gain entry into the civil service, so he turned to painting instead. In time, he gained recognition as one of the greatest artists China has ever known. This painting, showing high mountains, trees, and houses covered in snow, was made with extraordinary skill. Though it is over 500 years old, it looks as fresh and full of life as the day it was created.\nAlso of primary note is a collection of nearly 100 bronze objects from the Shang Dynasty (1600 BCE–1046 BCE). While the artists who made these great works are not known, they showed great skill in creating these beautiful pieces. Some of the items on display are thought to have come from the collection of Emperor Qianlong (1711–1799), a great admirer of Shang Dynasty bronze.\nFinally, we have many fine examples of Tang Dynasty (618–907) sculptures. Most of these are of Buddhist origin. Even though Buddhism entered China much earlier, it did not really begin to show expansion until the seventh century. During this same period, trade along the Silk Road also boomed. Chinese sculpture thus found itself highly influenced by Buddhist art brought from India and Central Asia through the Silk Road. These works were intended to spread Buddhism and they are of exceptional beauty and quality. Looking at the faces of the figures in these sculptures, one sees the faces of the past. History is brought to life.\nThis is just a small taste of what is in store for you in this exhibition. We guarantee that “From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages” will transport you to another time with its amazing collection of works.\n“From Shang to Qing: Chinese Art Through the Ages” will run until November 25.\nOpening hours are from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., from Tuesday to Sunday (the museum is closed on Mondays). No one will be admitted into the exhibition after 4:30 p.m.\nAdmission: $10 for adults; $8 for students; $5 for children under 12; free for children under 5.\nNo photos or food and drink are allowed in the museum.",

"title":"Habits for a Healthy Lifestyle",
"lastPosi":0.11127579291471303,
"text":"As teenagers grow up, they become more independent and start making their own decisions. However, during this period, it can be easy for some of them to form bad habits. These bad habits, if left unchecked, could lead to more serious ones when they become adults. For example, some of them may become involved in tobacco or alcohol abuse, which can lead to physical and mental health problems. To prevent harmful habits like these from dominating a teenager’s life is essential. They must learn to recognise bad habits early and make appropriate changes.\nTo change bad habits is never easy, even with many attempts. There is a famous saying based on the philosophy of Aristotle: “We are what we repeatedly do.” In many ways, our lifestyle is the sum of choices we have made. We make a choice to do something, and then we repeat it over and over again. Soon that choice becomes automatic and forms a habit that is much harder to change. The good news is that we can change, if we understand how habits work.\nAccording to modern psychology, we must first learn about the “habit cycle”, which works like this:\n• Firstly, there is a “cue”, an action, event, or situation that acts as a signal to do something.\n• Secondly, there is a “routine”, the regular action you take in response to the cue.\n• Thirdly, there is the “reward”, the good thing or feeling we get from the routine.\nFor example, when we feel unhappy (cue), we eat lots of unhealthy snacks (routine), which makes us feel happy (reward). The reward makes us much more likely to continue the cycle, and the bad habit of relying on unhealthy snacks is formed.\nTo facilitate a positive change in our bad habits, we must first examine our bad habit cycles and then try to adapt them. We can do this by combining the information from our habit cycles with our own positive ideas. For example, we could try to replace a negative routine with something more positive. So, when we feel unhappy again (cue), rather than eat snacks, we could listen to some of our favourite music instead (routine), which will make us feel relaxed (reward). Aside from changing bad habits, we can also use the habit cycle to create good habits. For example, when we come to an escalator (cue), our normal routine is to ride it, but we could change this routine into something more positive by taking the stairs instead.\nMany of us try to change bad habits quickly, and if we are not successful straight away, we often become pessimistic and give up. In fact, the most successful way to change is not suddenly, but over a period of time. As the Chinese philosopher Laozi wrote, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” One step seems small, but it is essential. To reach the goal of change, a person must show some discipline and repeatedly take many small steps. After all, it is not easy to break bad habits.\nFor young people, there is plenty of time to change bad habits. However, there is no “magic pill” or delete button that will help you; you have to think about your bad habits and decide on some changes. You have the power to build a happy and healthy life full of good habits!",

"lastPosi":0.7448194486845027,
"text":"We have known about climate change for decades. There is little doubt that Earth is getting warmer and warmer (see the graph). A warming ocean and atmosphere along with melting ice and rising sea levels provide evidence of a dramatic change in the global climate.\nIn 2013, a lot of people were shocked by a news photo of a dead polar bear that was found on Norway’s Arctic island of Svalbard. According to the scientists who found its dead body, all that remained of the polar bear was “skin and bones”. An expert who has studied polar bears for many years said that from the position of its dead body, the bear appeared to have starved and died. Experts claimed that low sea-ice levels caused by climate change meant the bear could not hunt seals as before, so it had to travel greater distances in order to find food. This alarming case showed how the increase in temperature had an impact on Earth’s ecology.\nThen what is causing the increase in the global average surface temperature? Climate scientists often mention a key climate process called the “greenhouse effect”, which has two common meanings: the “natural” greenhouse effect and the “man-made” greenhouse effect. The “natural” greenhouse effect refers to the fact that heat from the sun enters the atmosphere and warms Earth’s surface as short-wave radiation. The heat is released back into space at longer wave lengths. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as methane and carbon dioxide, trap some of the heat, keeping Earth’s climate warm and habitable. Without this process, Earth could not sustain life. However, the “man-made” greenhouse effect has now become a big problem. When people produce huge amounts of extra greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels, more heat energy is trapped in the atmosphere and causes Earth’s surface temperature to rise quickly.\nThere is strong and comprehensive evidence that the rise in temperature has led to an increase in extreme weather and natural disasters worldwide, not only causing serious damage, but also costing human lives. Climate scientists have warned that if we do not take appropriate actions, this warming trend will probably continue and there will be a higher price to pay. In fact, news reports are frequently broadcast about extreme rainstorms and heatwaves causing deaths and economic losses.\nContinued greenhouse gas emissions will result in further warming and long-lasting changes to the global climate. This requires the attention of people all over the world. Governments need to consider making policies and taking appropriate actions and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We as individuals can also reduce our “carbon footprint” by restricting the amount of carbon dioxide our lifestyles produce. It is our responsibility to seize every opportunity to educate everyone about global warming, along with its causes and impacts, because this is the most serious issue affecting all of us on this planet. So what will you do to help?\n",

"text":"Perce Blackborow joined an expedition with Sir Ernest Shackleton to Antarctica on the ship Endurance in 1914. Shackleton was one of the most famous explorers of his day and it was considered a great honour to be part of his expeditions. Below are some of Blackborow’s diary entries.\n\n---\n31 Oct 1914\n... Well, it so happened that one morning I bought a newspaper and read the advertisement about the Antarctic expedition.\nAn expedition to the South Pole with the great Sir Ernest Shackleton—this is the adventure that I have been dreaming of. And I was ready for it. At the age of 19, I am fit and full of vigour. However, when I applied to join the expedition, Shackleton turned me down because he thought I was too young and wasn’t qualified. But I was so enthusiastic about the idea of going along with them that I secretly went aboard his ship, the Endurance , and hid in a small cupboard. Unfortunately, three days after we set off I was discovered. Shackleton did not want to turn back so he offered me a job, but only after he promised me, “ If anyone has to be eaten, then you will be the first! ” He assigned me to be a steward, and I now serve meals for twenty-eight men, three times a day.\nHow everyone will envy me when I come back and tell them about the amazing places I have been to!\n\n---\n21 Nov 1915\nThe journey has not been easy. Endurance became stuck in the ice as we approached Antarctica. The ice froze around us and we were well and truly stuck! We saw the ship get crushed by the ice. And when the ship sank, our hearts sank with it.\nBefore we abandoned the ship, Shackleton calmly called us together and told us to rescue our most essential supplies—the small boats, our food, the cook stove, candles, clothes, and blankets. This was no time to panic. We were not allowed to take most of our personal belongings, and Shackleton himself threw away all his gold. But to our surprise, he allowed Hussey to keep his banjo. Hussey often plays it to keep our spirits up.\nWe are now camped on the ice and we have been managing to survive, but spring is coming, and the ice will soon begin to melt.\n\n---\n20 May 1916\nWe have been struggling for days, but things on Elephant Island are going from bad to worse. We are now crowded together under one of our boats on the rocky shore of this miserable place. Soon after we arrived, Shackleton left us to find help on South Georgia Island, 1,320 kilometres away—the Ernest Shackleton voyage was too dangerous and difficult for all of us to make it in our small boats. If Shackleton fails, will we have any hope of rescue? No. No navy in the world ever stops at Elephant Island, and no one else knows that we are here.\nI feel low. It’s cold and windy. The island has no plants. Sometimes we are able to catch a seal or a penguin to eat. Otherwise, there is no food. I try to think of happier things: decent food, warm and dry clothes, a cosy bedroom, sunny days, and my mother’s face ... However, these happy memories are soon interrupted by a sudden cold rush of air.\nI shouted, “Shut the door!”\n“Hold on now, Perce. Don’t you go turning into another Tom,” came the reply. “We’ve caught another penguin, so it’s penguin soup tonight!”\nBless Frank Wild, the kindest man there is after our leader, Ernest Shackleton. How could I become as selfish and bad-tempered as Thomas Orde-Lees!\nWithout Frank and Ernest, we’d all be dead by now. Their genuine concern for others, their perseverance, and their resolve fill me with hope.\nPerhaps there is a chance we will return home, after all.",

"text":"## letter 1\nDear Editor,\nAfter I attended your summer camp about health and lifestyle choices, I realised I hardly ever felt well, either physically or mentally. I often felt sleepy and dizzy, and lacked passion. Most worrying, though, I got the flu easily and experienced many toothaches, too.\nAt the end of the camp I heard, “Change the world by changing yourself.” This stimulated my motivation. A dentist once examined me and told me that too much sugar in my meals had damaged my teeth and health. I made up my mind to change two things in my life: to eat nothing with sugar and to exercise regularly.\nAfter that I stopped buying all the sweets, biscuits, and sugary drinks that I used to have every day. Whenever I went out with friends, I brought snacks from home, things that didn’t have any added sugar: fruit, nuts, dried meat, etc.\nMy exercise was very simple: I went outside every day for at least 30 minutes and did something active. Sometimes I played table tennis or badminton with my cousins. Other times I jumped on my skateboard and rode around my neighbourhood, or just took a long walk.\nThe results have been fantastic. I feel more dynamic and stronger than ever, in both body and mind. I sleep soundly at night now. I no longer suffer from a flu virus or toothaches either. Best of all, in my opinion, is how I feel about myself. I feel like I’m in control of my own life. To make choices about myself is within my own power. I CAN change myself. I just need to try.\nYours truly,\nWang Lu\n## letter 2\nDear Editor,\nAs I took part in the summer camp about personal life choices, I started to analyse my choices, especially what I did to relax and how it was affecting my whole life.\nAfter starting high school, I felt stressed out and always relaxed by playing computer games. I got so absorbed that I played the games day and night. Playing was fun, but I felt even more worn out afterwards! So after the camp, I realised that it was very, very important to adjust my lifestyle. I decided to take control of my life and find other ways to relax.\nIt was a big struggle not to join my friends in playing online games as I’m mad for them. However, I realised that to succeed in quitting, I had to replace it with something else. So I thought about what to try. Rock climbing, bowling, watching comedies, and playing basketball were the things I thought of doing instead.\nNow my dad and I go rock climbing together monthly! It has enhanced the quality of my life, improving my health and increasing my happiness. I get refreshed through climbing, spend more time with my dad, and get to meet new friends.\nAfter six months of trying out new ways of relaxing, I feel much more energetic. I feel that I can change myself for the better. And if that’s true for me, then it might truly be possible to change the world for the better. As Gandhi said, “Be the change you want to see in the world.”\nSincerely,\nGeorge Fielding",

"title":"A Few Simple Forms of English Poems",
"lastPosi":0.6145613121996462,
"text":"There are various reasons why people compose poetry. Some poems tell a story or describe a certain image in the reader’s mind. Others try to convey certain feelings such as joy and sorrow. The distinctive characteristics of poetry often include economical use of words, descriptive and vivid language, integrated imagery, literary devices such as similes and metaphors, and arrangement of words, lines, rhymes, and rhythm. Poets use many different forms of poetry to express themselves. Now we will look at a few of the simpler forms.\nSome of the first poems a young child learns in English are nursery rhymes. They are usually the traditional poems or folk songs. The language of these rhymes, like Poem A, is to the point but has a storyline. Many children enjoy nursery rhymes because they rhyme, have a strong rhythm, and often repeat the same words. The poems may not make sense and even seem contradictory, but they are easy to learn and recite. By playing with the words in nursery rhymes, children learn about language.\nOne of the simplest kinds of poem is the “list poem”, which contains a list of things, people, ideas, or descriptions that develop a particular theme. List poems have a flexible line length and repeated phrases which give both a pattern and a rhythm to the poem. Some rhyme, while others do not.\nAnother simple form of poem that amateurs can easily write is the cinquain , which is made up of five lines. With these, you can convey a strong picture or a certain mood in just a few words. Look at the example.\nHaiku is a Japanese form of poetry that consists of 17 syllables. It has a format of three lines, containing 5, 7, and 5 syllables respectively. It is not a traditional form of English poetry, but is very popular with English writers. It is easy to write and, like the cinquain , can give a clear picture and create a special feeling using very few words. The haiku poem on the right is a translation from Japanese, which shows a moment in the life of a delicate butterfly.\nEnglish speakers also enjoy poems from China, those from the Tang Dynasty in particular. A lot of Tang poetry has been translated into English, such as this one.\nWith so many different forms of poetry to choose from, you may eventually want to write poems of your own. Give it a try!\n",

"title":"Reducing Water Pollution in the Li River",
"lastPosi":0.40184563758389263,
"text":"The beautiful Li River and its amazing surrounding scenery is one of the most well-known tourist destinations in China’s Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It attracts millions of domestic and foreign visitors each year. However, its reputation as a top destination has had negative effects on the river’s water quality. This report looks at the problem of water pollution and some actions that have been taken to deal with it.\nPreviously, water quality in the Li River had suffered greatly from an increasing volume of tourists, many of whom frequently threw garbage into the river. Many tour boats contributed to the problem too. Kitchens on board were using lots of oil, which was often thrown into the water. The growth in tourism also meant the local population rose rapidly, as well as the number of commercial and industrial enterprises. Water pollution levels increased, with more household and commercial waste ending up in the river. In order to feed more people, more chemicals were used to increase crop production. These chemicals led to severe water quality issues, causing a decrease in the number of fish species. Local officials were concerned that the pollution was damaging the natural environment and felt that urgent steps should be taken to restore the river’s original beauty.\nA comprehensive initiative was started, with a number of measures that addressed the issues. The construction of waste water treatment facilities improved the water quality and water conservation. The collection and transport of household waste was also improved. Dozens of polluting enterprises were closed or moved. The local government set up strict regulations regarding further industrial development. New rules were also introduced regarding tour boat routes and garbage disposal methods. Furthermore, the local authorities began to use the media to spread environmental awareness and encourage greater use of clean energy. At the same time, they started to carry out inspections regularly and fine tourist organisations for abuses. With these measures, it is believed that the beauty of the Li River will be preserved for generations to come.\nIn addition, the ambitious “Water Ten Plan” is also now tackling water pollution across the country. Other initiatives, such as the “River Chief System”, hold senior officials responsible for reducing water pollution. With such campaigns in effect, China’s waterways are heading towards a clean and sustainable future.",

"title":"Express Your Opinions on Sea Exploration",
"lastPosi":0.659114315139032,
"text":"## Text 1\nWhen people talk of exploring the sea more, they usually mean exploiting it. Sea exploration has caused many problems and will continue to cause more.\nMore exploration means more pollution. The Deepwater Horizon spilled over 200 million gallons of oil into the sea in 2010. Plastic pollution is also bad, killing many birds and fish, and has even been found in our tap water.\nMining for resources is very damaging, especially in the Arctic. Because of climate change, there is less ice now, which means we can look for more fossil fuels further north. But if we burn these, the ice will melt more and this negative cycle will continue. Climate change is warning us that something is very wrong.\nOverfishing is another problem. Whales and dolphins are also hunted for their meat or for so-called research. Although this was banned in 1982, some countries are still “murdering” these intelligent creatures without mercy.\nThe sea is home to life, not human beings’ possessions. It is huge, but it is more sensitive than we think. If we do not protect it, future generations will not forgive us.\n## Text 2\nTo truly understand our planet, we must explore the oceans which cover most of it. Opponents may be concerned, but sea exploration is important for our future. For example, scientific research ships can help address important issues such as climate change. We need to understand what is happening to our planet so that we can take action. Therefore, more research is necessary.\nUnderstanding more about the sea will also help us manage its resources better. Logging new species will improve our understanding of life on the earth. It may help us discover new medicines, as well as new sources of food and energy. Accessing the deep ocean may also help us to predict events such as earthquakes.\nThe population of the world is growing and we need new resources for future development. There are probably vast amounts of resources under the sea and ice, not just oil and gas but also valuable minerals.\nOf course, there are still environmental risks. However, these should be balanced with economic needs. Hopefully, as technology improves, we may have more options for managing this balance.",

"text":"## Preparing to travel\n25 Sep\nNext week I’m travelling to Australia to visit a friend there over the school holidays. I plan to keep this blog to record my experiences and what I learn. I have already done some research on the country. Located to the south of the equator, below many other countries on the globe, it’s often informally referred to as “down under”.\nI have also read about some iconic sites, such as the Sydney Opera House and the Great Ocean Road, and animals like the cute koalas and kangaroos. I can’t wait to see all of them! However, as I major in social studies, I’m more interested in meeting people in Australia and experiencing their culture, food, and way of life.\n## First impressions\n1 Oct\nI’m here in Sydney! Since I arrived, my friend has brought me to my first open-air barbecue and has also shared many different but yummy meals with me, so my first impressions of Australia have been all about food! A lot of typical Australian food, such as the Sunday roast, is originally British. Bakeries, fast-food joints, butcher shops, cafes, and restaurants everywhere provide some of the premier food experiences in the world. The influence of Asian cultures, on the other hand, led to the introduction of bean curd and Asian herbs, along with Australian dim sim versions of foods like the Chinese-inspired dim sim.\n## Aborigines and the didgeridoo\n3 Oct\nMy friend and I have arrived in Katherine, a town in Australia’s Northern Territory. We’re here to learn about the life and customs of the Aborigines, who are native to Australia. The Aboriginal population might be small, but its influence is still visible. For example, “Bondi” in “Bondi Beach” is an Aboriginal word meaning “water breaking over rocks”.\nTo survive in this vast land on the ocean, the Aborigines had to be in close contact with nature. This shows in their music, too, which celebrates the natural world and the spiritual world around them. Most of their musical instruments are really just sticks found on the ground, among which there is an amazing instrument called the didgeridoo.\nThe didgeridoo is made from a tree branch which is hollow. To play the didgeridoo, you put your mouth on one end and blow while vibrating your lips. Unlike a horn, there are no finger holes. The didgeridoo player has to change the shape of his mouth in order to change pitch. A skilled player can play for a long time without stopping to breathe. He does this by continually breathing in through his nose while breathing out through his mouth and into the didgeridoo. I tried to learn how to play it, but after trying for hours, I was convinced that I could never make a musical sound with this instrument!\n## Reflections on multiculturalism\n6 Oct\nIt’s almost time for me to say goodbye to Australia. I’ve enjoyed my time here very much. After being here for a while, my biggest impression is the complicated mix of peoples and cultures that make up the nation. Although the main cultural influence since 1788 has been Western culture, minority cultures have also played a part in shaping the unique Australian culture, with many of the new cultural influences contributed by immigrants. It is said that now nearly half of all Australian citizens were either born overseas or have parents who were born overseas.\nPersonally speaking, what I like most about Australia is the people themselves. They have a straightforward and free-and-easy attitude towards life, and their friendliness and warmth made me feel at home wherever I went.\nAfter experiencing Australia, I have to say that I agree with the tourism slogan: “There’s nothing like Australia.”\n ",

"title":"China’s Aid to Other Countries",
"lastPosi":0.7403591135160519,
"text":"Hello! My name is Zhan Bingbing.\nLately, all of us have seen Chinese people on TV in far-off places in the world, helping other countries to develop. We see Chinese workers building roads in the Congo, a port in Pakistan, railways in Panama, and an airport in Sri Lanka. And we see Chinese miners, oil workers, agricultural experts, mechanics, and doctors working in nearly every corner of the world. And some people may ask, “Is it worth it? Why help people overseas when China has many areas that are still in need of development?”\nI had the same questions myself. But for me, it was much more personal. You see, my mother is a medical doctor, and for the last two years, she has been working as a volunteer consultant in Tanzania, Africa, as a part of a medical team sent by the Chinese government.\nTo be honest, when my mother first left for Africa, I was upset. My mother cooked me dinner every night, and she took good care of me. But more importantly, she was my best friend. We talked together, we spent our leisure time together, and except for school and work, we were never apart. So I was unhappy about her leaving without even asking for my input.\nBut then I began to hear about the work she was doing in Tanzania, a country that has many health problems, and now I am singing a different tune. Many dangerous diseases which are rare in China are quite commonly contracted in Tanzania. And, while the country is quite beautiful and has much natural wealth, many of the people are quite poor and live without things we take for granted, such as electricity, running water, cars and good transport systems, and supermarkets. One project that my mother worked on was helping to build a cardiac hospital. Prior to this, if a Tanzanian had a heart condition and needed surgery, they would have to go abroad. Since this was quite expensive, many people went without medical treatment and some even died. Now, not only are Tanzanians helped by the hospital, but people in neighbouring countries are helped as well. It has made a big difference to their lives. My mother also does a circuit of the rural villages to provide medical treatment, help those with disabilities, and provide consultation and training for local doctors. In addition, her team has given patients a new malaria treatment invented in China, and this has saved many lives.\nToday, I want to relay to you that I’m proud of the work my mother has done, and I am now supportive of it. Is her work worth it? Yes, to the lives of the people she is helping, it is worth it.\nBut by any criteria this work is worth it to us as well, because it shows that we are global citizens interested in world stability, and that we feel responsible for others and are ready to build a community with a shared future for mankind. Everyone deserves a fair chance in life. When I think of all the things that we as Chinese citizens can be most proud of, helping others comes at the top of this list. Now that I understand how important my mother’s work is, I’ve decided to become a volunteer myself to help people in other lands. In the future, I pray that you will do the same.\nThank you!",

"title":"The Amazing Animals of Australia",
"lastPosi":0.6555393763950893,
"text":"Our topic today is “Creatures Unique to Australia”, with questions answered by wildlife expert, Dr Jim Smith.\nAustralia has lots of unique animals, but which animal is a symbol of the country?\nIt has to be the kangaroo, as it has a wide distribution throughout the country. It’s a tough animal that has to survive in a difficult environment. Also, it cannot walk backwards, so it is always moving forwards. This expresses the strength and resolve of the Australians as individuals and as a nation. Baby kangaroos weigh only two grammes at birth. They then find their way into their mother’s pouch—a kind of pocket—to stay safe and warm. They sleep and drink milk in that temporary, protected environment until they are about seven or eight months old. After this phase, they go out to try their legs. After they learn to jump, they gradually spend less time with their mother and learn to be independent. Kangaroos may look cute, but encounters with them don’t always end so well. Kangaroos can hit and kick very hard, so please folks, if you see some kangaroos, remember they’re not for petting!\nKoalas are cute, and we see so many pictures of people holding them. But in many places in Australia, it is against the law to even touch them. Can you clarify that?\nThey are really quite cute, but the truth is, koalas are very sensitive creatures who can easily panic because of even small changes in their environment. They spend quite a lot of time eating, sleeping, and hanging onto tree trunks, so interaction with humans can cause them a lot of stress. Because of this, the government began to make laws against touching koalas, in the interest of animal protection, as well as public safety. So, if you see one in the wild, you shouldn’t approach it to pick it up or even touch it. If you want to hold a koala, you have to go to certain licensed zoos where animal experts make sure that the koalas selected for each session are in a good state for human contact and that they are handled for only a limited time and on a limited frequency of occasions. So, we’ve talked about some cute animals.\nWhat about animals which aren’t so cute?\nMy favourite is a little creature called the Tasmanian devil. If you are out camping in Tasmania and come across one, the experience might scare you! Tasmanian devils hunt at night, so you won’t usually see them, but you may hear their loud cries when they are fighting or eating. The noise they make could wake the dead. Frightening! They are about the size of small dogs and look like rather large black rats. They also have a terrible smell! Their diet is mostly dead animals. Fortunately, despite their name, they are generally not violent towards people.\nAustralia also has some animals that many people have never heard of, for example, the duck-billed platypus. Is that some kind of bird?\nNot at all. While it may lay eggs in a nest like a bird, it’s really a primitive mammal, with a unique biology. Its eggs hatch after about ten days, and then the baby platypus nurses from its mother like all other mammals. Its nose looks like a duck’s bill, and it has feet like a duck’s so it can dive under the water, but it’s covered in hair. Do you know what’s really strange about a platypus? The platypus doesn’t use its senses of sight or smell to find food. It has a capacity to find food in the water by using electrical sensors in its bill. There are only a small handful of animals in the world that can do that!",

"text":"It was at ten o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last check, and sat myself in the leather seat. I pushed the starting lever on the main panel forwards an inch then immediately backwards again. Looking around, I saw my laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? I thought my mind had tricked me. Then I saw the clock. A moment before, it was a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half past three!\nI drew a breath, gripped the lever and pushed it forwards. The laboratory went hazy around me. My niece came in to fetch something, maybe her handkerchief, apparently without seeing me. It probably took her a minute, but to me she moved like a rocket! I pushed the lever further. Night came as if a lamp was being turned out, and in another moment came the day. Tomorrow night came, then skipped to day, again and again, faster and faster still.\nIt is hard to explain the strange and unpleasant feeling of time travelling. It felt like I was being driven fast on a winding road. As my pace grew faster, the walls of the laboratory fell away, and I was left in the open air. The sun and moon looked as if they were being thrown across the sky, but soon there was division between night and day. Around me I saw trees growing like puffs of smoke; they grew, spread, and died in moments. I saw huge buildings rise up, then disappear like in a dream. The whole surface of the earth was being changed, melting and flowing before my eyes. I calculated that I was being pushed through time at hundreds of years a minute.\nI had a strong urge to look at the random things that were being flashed before my eyes! I had thought about the risk of stopping the Time Machine many times. So long as I travelled at maximum speed, it didn’t matter. But if I stopped and the same space was being occupied by something else, we would be forced together and explode like a bomb! Like an impatient fool, I pulled the lever backwards hard. With a sudden jolt, the Time Machine was flipped on its side, and I was thrown through the air.\nI was stunned for a moment, and then heard the sound of thunder. I was sitting in the rain in some mud next to the machine. “A fine welcome,” I said, “for a man who has travelled thousands of years to be here!”",

"text":"Larry Belmont worked for a company that made robots. Recently it had begun experimenting with a household robot. It was going to be tested out by Larry’s wife, Claire.\nClaire didn’t want the robot in her house, especially as her husband would be away on a business trip for three weeks, but Larry persuaded her that the robot wouldn’t harm her or allow her to be harmed. It would be a bonus. However, when she first saw the robot, she felt alarmed. His name was Tony. He seemed more like a human than a machine. He was tall and handsome with smooth hair and a deep voice, although his facial expression never changed.\nOn the second morning, Tony brought her breakfast and then asked her whether she needed help dressing. She felt embarrassed and quickly told him to go. Now she was being looked after by a robot that looked so human, and it was disturbing.\nOne day, Claire mentioned that she didn’t think she was clever. Tony said that she must feel very unhappy to say that. Claire thought it was ridiculous that she was being offered sympathy by a robot, but she gradually admired his wisdom and integrity and began to trust him. He always treated her with dignity. She told him how she was unhappy that her home wasn’t elegant enough for Larry, who wanted to improve his social position with a bigger salary. She wasn’t like Gladys Claffern, one of the richest and most powerful women around.\nAs a favour, Tony promised to help Claire make herself more beautiful and her home more elegant. So Claire borrowed some library books for him to read, or rather, scan. She looked at his fingers with wonder as they turned each page. How absurd, she thought. He was just a machine.\nTony gave Claire a new hairstyle and improved her makeup. As he was not allowed to accompany her to the shops, he wrote out a list of things that he would need for his work on the house. Claire went downtown and bought these things. She had an appointment to paint her nails, then she went into an expensive clothes shop. The saleswoman there was rude to her, so she rang Tony and told him she was being treated badly. He spoke to the woman, who immediately changed her attitude. Claire thanked Tony, telling him that he was a “dear”. As she turned around, there stood Gladys Claffern. How awful to be discovered by her, Claire thought. By the look on her face, Claire knew that Gladys thought they were in a relationship. After all, she knew Claire’s husband’s name was Larry, not Tony. Although it was completely innocent, Claire felt guilty.\nWhen Claire got home, she wept. Gladys was everything Claire wished to be. Tony told her she was being sensitive and was just as good as Gladys. He suggested that she invite Gladys and her friends to the house the night before he was to leave and Larry was to return. By that time, Tony expected that the house, which was being completely transformed, would be ready.\nTony worked steadily on the improvements. Claire tried to help by working on a light suspended from the ceiling, but she fell off the ladder. Even though Tony had been in the next room, he managed to catch her in time. As he held her, she felt the warmth of his body. She screamed, pushed him away, and ran to her room.\nThe night of the party arrived. The clock struck eight. The guests would be arriving soon, so Claire dismissed Tony for the rest of the night. At that moment, Tony took her in his arms, bringing his face close to hers. She heard him declare that he did not want to leave her the next day, and that he felt more than just the desire to please her. Then the front door bell rang.",

"text":"As an adult, one of the first questions you are asked when meeting someone new is, “What do you do?”This is because your career is a very important part of who you are. The career you have defines your life, and so taking time to think about it is an essential exercise for young people.\nThe best time to start thinking about possible careers is while you are still at school, before you make any choices about your further education. This, however, is not always easy. Some people know what they want to do from a young age, but many others just have a few ideas bouncing around in their heads.\nOne of the most effective ways to get some insight on a possible career path is to complete a “career aptitude test”. The results of the test will tell you about your strengths and interests, and some tests also suggest careers that you may be suited to. Having this information will provide you with a better chance of finding a job you like. There are many free tests online, so give one a try. Getting a head start in considering your future career may help you for the rest of your life. You don’t want to look back in years to come and say, “I wish I had thought more about what I really wanted to do.”\nThere are many different kinds of career aptitude tests. Some ask questions about your personal interests and attitudes. Others focus more on asking you to rate different kinds of work scenarios, like working as a librarian or a lawyer. Of course, while completing these sorts of tests, it is very important to be honest—and don’t worry—there are no right or wrong answers.\nOne popular test asks the participants to grade their preferences for a variety of work tasks. Their answers are then analysed and divided up between six different types of work personalities. The participant is then given a chart showing their score for each type of work personality. The top three scores are used to make a code that indicates the participant’s overall work personality. This code is then used to generate a list of career suggestions.\nThe career suggestions are also based on your education and experience level, but you can look at higher-level careers as well, which is very useful for high school students. For example, you could look at the basic careers to see what work you might like now, and then look at the more advanced careers so you know what you may like to aim for in the future. This is a great tool to help plan your career and let you know what targets you need to reach to get there.\nIn conclusion, career aptitude tests are clearly a very useful tool. However, it is important to remember that they are only meant for guidance. The secret to a good career is finding something that you are passionate about. So try a few tests online and start thinking about your future career right now!",

"lastPosi":0.9386902674610423,
"text":"Trade and curiosity have often formed the foundation of mankind’s greatest achievements. To complete the great map of the world was a strong passion for the people of early civilisations. Marco Polo’s tales inspired European explorers to search for sea routes from west to east. However, merchants and explorers from the East set sail from east to west many years before Columbus first did.\nIn ancient times, silk from China found its way overland to India, the Middle East, and Rome, along what became known as the Silk Road. A trading route across the sea was also extended along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, centred around Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Here, merchants from China and many other places met to negotiate trade deals, which also led to more awareness of each other’s cultures. Over the centuries, further trading allowed more exploration of the regions to the west of China, as recorded in Du Huan’s Record of My Travels in the eighth century.\nLater, the Ming Dynasty further developed relations with these regions. Between 1405 and 1433, seven large fleets sailed west on voyages of trade and exploration. These fleets were a sight to behold and were in a league of their own at that time. Under the command of Zheng He, they set sail from the South China Sea across the Indian Ocean to the mouth of the Red Sea, and then to the east coast of Africa. African royal families sent gifts such as giraffes as gestures of friendship in return for gold, silk, and spices. Although China withdrew from further expeditions after 1433, these land and sea routes remained active channels between other cultures for centuries.\nTo reach out across the sea remains a strong desire today. The ancient sea routes travelled by Zheng He are being revisited with the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which is part of the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThe aim of this initiative is to encourage cooperation and trade across the historic Silk Road areas, and strengthen the bonds between China and the rest of the world. Trading has grown greatly in recent years, and will continue to do so in years to come. China has invested billions in systems and services along these routes, which will help to greatly develop the whole area for the benefit of future trade and cultural exchange.\nChina has also joined its friends across the sea on other important projects. Although the ancient sea routes of Zheng He have been travelled many times, there are still many other places left to explore. In recent years, China has joined other nations on several expeditions to explore the Arctic. From a scientific point of view, there is an urgent need to study the Arctic in order to understand climate change and its effects.\nHundreds of years on, and with the latest technology in hand, the need to trade and the desire to enhance relationships will drive China to reach out across the sea far into the future.",

"text":"8 March\nI just got a parcel from home! It took about two weeks to arrive, and it was a bit damaged, but it was so nice to get some sweets and jam from home; I’ve been dying to have some of my favourite sweets, and it’s always nice to get mail!\nSo I’ve been here in the jungle for about a month now. My secondary school is a bush school. The classrooms are made of bamboo, with clay floors and roofs of grass. It takes me only a few minutes to walk to school down a dusty track covered in weeds. When I reach the school grounds, I’m greeted by a chorus of “good morning” from the boys. Unlike students in our country, these boys do not wear cotton uniforms, and many of them also have to walk a long way, sometimes for up to two hours, just to get to school.\nThere’s no electricity, running water or even textbooks, not to mention laptops, tablets, or other modern devices! All the students have are pencils, rubbers, and paper. I’m still trying to adapt to these conditions. I’ve had to become much more imaginative in my teaching. Science is my most challenging subject as my students have no concept of doing experiments. There is no equipment, and since there isn’t even a washroom, if I need water I have to carry it from my house in a basin! It’s important not to be too rigid about rules here, too. The other day I was showing the boys a chemistry experiment when, before I knew it, the mixture was bubbling out of the test tube spilling everywhere! The class became a circus as the boys, who had never come across anything like this before, started jumping out of the windows. Sometimes I wonder how relevant chemistry is to these students—few will ever become chemists—and most will be going back to their villages after Year 8 anyway. To be honest, I doubt whether I’m making any difference to these boys’ lives at all.\n17 April\nLast weekend I made my first visit to a remote village, home to one of our students, Tombe. Another teacher and I walked for two and a half hours to get there—first, up a mountain from where we had fantastic views, and then down a shaded path to the valley below. When we arrived at the village, Tombe’s mother, Kiak, saw us coming and started crying “ieee ieee”. We shook hands with all the villagers. Everyone seemed to be related to Tombe.\nTombe’s father, Mukap, a man with a strong jaw and a wrinkled forehead, led us to his house, a low, round bamboo hut with no windows, with a door just big enough to get through, and with grass sticking out of the roof—this shows it is a man’s house. Such housing is dark inside so it took time for our eyes to adjust. Fresh grass had been laid on the floor and there was a platform for Jenny and me to sleep on. There was a fireplace in the centre of the hut. The only possessions I could see were one broom, a few saucers, a kettle, cups, pans, and a couple of jars.\nMukap built a fire outside and laid stones on it to heat. He then placed the hot stones in an empty oil drum with kau kau (sweet potato), ripe corn, and greens. He then covered the vegetables with banana leaves and left them to steam. It smelled delicious. We ate inside the hut sitting round the fire. I loved listening to the family talking softly to each other in their language, even though I could not participate much in the conversation. Luckily, Tombe interpreted for us.\nLater, I noticed a can standing upside down on the grill over the fire. After a while, Tombe threw it out of the doorway. Tombe told me that the can was heated to dry out the leftover food. His family believes that leftovers attract bad spirits in the night, so any leftover food is dried up in a can and the can is then thrown out of the hut.\nWe left the village the next morning after many goodbyes and firm handshakes. My muscles were aching and my knees shaking as we dragged ourselves down the mountain towards home. That evening I fell happily into bed. It was such a privilege to have spent a day with Tombe’s family.",

"title":"The Most Magnificent Spectacle on Earth",
"lastPosi":0.4820463261549077,
"text":"(Adapted from Canyons of the Colorado by John Wesley Powell)\nThe Grand Canyon of the Colorado is a canyon composed of many canyons. It is a complex mix of thousands, of tens of thousands, of gorges. In a similar manner, each wall of the canyon is a wall composed of many walls. Every one of these gorges is a world of beauty in itself. Yet all these canyons unite to form one grand canyon, the most gorgeous spectacle on earth.\nThe carving of the Grand Canyon is the work of rains and rivers. When a shower comes in this land, the streams carve canyons-but a little at each storm; and though storms are far apart and the heavens above are cloudless for most of the days of the year, still, years are plenty in the ages, and an occasional stream called to life by a shower can do much work in centuries of centuries.\nIn winter some of the characteristics of the Grand Canyon are emphasised. The black rocks below, the varied quartzite , and the green sandstone form the foundation for the enormous red wall. The banded sand stone is crowned by the tower limestone. In winter this is covered with snow. Seen from below, these changing elements seem to graduate into the heavens, and no plane of separation between wall and blue sky can be seen. The heavens make up a part of the wall and form a vast dome from wall to wall, spanning the Grand Canyon with heavenly blue so that the earth and the heavens are blended in one vast structure.\nWhen the clouds play in the canyon, as they often do in the rainy season, another set of effects is produced. Clouds creep out of canyons and wind into other canyons. The heavens seem to be alive, not moving as the heavens move over a plain, in one direction with the wind, but following the multiplied courses of these gorges. In this manner the little clouds seem to be individualised, to have wills and souls of their own, and to be going on diverse jobs--a vast assembly of self-willed clouds, faring here and there, intent upon purposes hidden in their own breasts. In the imagination the clouds belong to the sky, and when they are in the canyon the skies come down into the gorges and cling to the cliffs and lift them up to vast heights, for the sky must still be far away. Thus they lend infinity to the walls.\nThe wonders of the Grand Canyon cannot be adequately represented by speech itself. The huge forms which result from the sculpture of storms through ages are formed into endless details. Besides the elements of form, there are elements of colour, for here the colours of the heavens are rivalled by the colours of the rocks. But form and colour are not all of the divine qualities of the Grand Canyon. It is the land of music. The river thunders in constant roar, swelling in floods of music when the storms play upon the rocks and fading away in soft whispers when the infinite blue of heaven is unveiled. With the melody of the great tide rising and falling, swelling and vanishing forever, other melodies are heard in the gorges of the side canyons, while the waters plunge in the rapids among the rocks or leap in great waterfalls. Thus the Grand Canyon is a land of song. Altogether it is a symphony of melodies.\nThe beauties of form, colour, and sound unite in the Grand Canyon--forms unrivalled even by the mountains, colours that contend with sunsets, and sounds that span the musical scale from storm to raindrop, from waterfall to bubbling fountain. Its colours, though many and complex at any instant, change with the rising and setting sun; lights and shadows appear and vanish with the passing clouds, and the changing seasons mark their passage in changing colours. You cannot see the Grand Canyon in one view, as if it were a changeless spectacle from which a curtain might be lifted, but to see it you have to strive from month to month through its gorges. It is a region more difficult to pass through than the Alps or the Himalayas. However, if you have enough strength and courage, after a year of work you will gain an understanding of the Grand Canyon’s magnificence, which can only be compared to the magnificence of paradise.\n",

"text":"Wednesday, 3 May 1944\nDear Kitty,\n... As you can easily imagine we often ask ourselves here despairingly: “What, oh, what is the use of the war? Why can’t people live peacefully together? Why all this destruction?”\nThe question is very understandable, but no one has found a satisfactory answer to it so far. Yes, why do they manufacture still larger aircraft and still heavier bombs? Why should millions be spent daily on cannons and yet there’s not a penny available for medical services, artists, or for poor people?\nWhy do some people have to starve, while there are surpluses rotting in other parts of the world? Oh, why are people so crazy?\nI don’t believe that the big men, the politicians and the capitalists alone, are guilty of this warfare. Oh no, the little man is just as guilty, otherwise the people of the world would have risen in revolt long ago! In people, there’s simply an urge to destroy, an urge to kill, to murder and rage, and until all mankind, without exception, undergoes a great change, wars will be waged, everything that has been built up, cultivated, and grown will be destroyed and disfigured, after which mankind will have to begin all over again.\nI have often been downcast, but never in despair; I regard our hiding as a dangerous adventure, romantic and interesting at the same time. In my diary I treat all the hardships as amusing. I have made up my mind now to lead a different life from other girls and, later on, different from ordinary housewives. What I’m experiencing here is a good beginning to an interesting life, and that is the sole reason why I have to laugh at the humorous side of the most dangerous moments.\nI am young and I possess many hidden qualities; I am young and strong and am living a great adventure; I am still in the midst of it and can’t mutter the whole day long. I have been given a lot: a happy nature, a great deal of cheerfulness and strength. Every day I feel that I am developing inwardly, that the liberation is drawing nearer and how beautiful nature is, how good the people are about me, how interesting this adventure is! Why, then, should I be in despair?\nYours,\nAnne\n\n\n---\n\nThursday, 15 June 1944\nDear Kitty,\nI wonder if it’s because I haven’t been able to poke my nose outdoors for so long that I’ve grown so obsessive about everything to do with nature. I can well remember that there was a time when a deep blue sky, the song of the birds, moonlight and flowers could never have kept me spellbound. That’s changed since I’ve been here.\nAt Whitsun, for instance, when it was so warm, I stayed awake on purpose until half past eleven one evening in order to gaze at the moon for once by myself. Alas, the sacrifice was all in vain, as the moon gave far too much light and I couldn’t risk opening a window. Another time, some months ago, I happened to be upstairs one evening when the window was open. I didn’t go downstairs until the window had to be shut. The dark, rainy evening, the gale, the moving clouds held me entirely in their power; it was the first time in a year and a half that I’d seen the night face to face. After that evening my longing to see it again was greater than my fear of intruders, rats, and raids on the house. I went downstairs all by myself and looked outside through the windows in the kitchen and the private office. A lot of people are fond of nature, but few are so shut away and isolated from that which can be shared alike by rich and poor.\nIt’s not imagination on my part when I say that to look upwards at the sky, the clouds, the moon, and the stars makes me calm and patient. Mother Nature makes me humble and prepared to face every blow courageously.\nAlas, it has to be said that I am only able--except on a few rare occasions--to look at nature through dirty lace curtains hanging before very dusty windows. And it’s no delight looking through these any longer, because nature is just the one thing which there is no substitute.\nYours,\nAnne",

"text":"Adapted from“Nature”by Ralph Waldo Emerson\nRalph Waldo Emerson(1803-1882), who was born and lived most of his life in Massachusetts, USA, was a famous poet and essayist.\n\nTo go into solitude, a man needs to retire as much from his chamber as from society. I am not solitary while I read and write, though nobody is with me. But if a man would be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds will separate between him and what he touches. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the eternal presence of magnificence. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the glory which had been shown! But every night come out these representatives of beauty, and light the universe with their smile.\nThe stars awaken a certain awe, because though always present, they are inaccessible; but all natural objects make a similar impression, when the mind is open to their influence. Nature never wears a mean appearance. Neither does the wisest man obtain her secret, and lose his curiosity by finding out all her perfection. Nature never became a toy fo a wise spirit. The flowers, the animals, the mountains, reflected the wisdom of his best hour, as much as they had delighted the simplicity of his childhood.\nWhen we speak of nature in this manner, we have a distinct but most poetical sense in the mind. We mean the integrity of impression made by many different natural objects. It is this which distinguishes the log of the wood-cutter, from the tree of the poet.\nTo speak truly, few adults can see nature. Most people do not see the sun. At least they have a very superficial seeing. The sun illuminates only the eye of the man, but shines into the eye and the heart of the child. The lover of nature is he whose inward and outward senses are still truly adjusted to each other; who has retained the spirit of infancy even into the era of manhood. In the presence of nature, a wild delight runs through the man, in spite of real sorrows. Not the sun or the summer alone, but every hour and season brings delight; for every hour and change brings a different state of the mind, from breathless noon to grimmest midnight. In good health, the air is a medicine of incredible virtue. Strolling across a bare common, in snow puddles at twilight, under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any occurrence of special good fortune, I have enjoyed a perfect delight. I’m glad to the edge of fear.\nIn the woods too, a man casts off his years, as the snake his skin, and at what period so ever of life, is always a child. In the woods, is eternal youth. In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing bad can happen to me in life--no disgrace, no disaster, which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare ground--my head bathed by the happy air, and lifted up into infinite space--all of my shallow egotism fades away. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all.\nI am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty. In the wilderness, I find something dearer than in streets or villages. In the peaceful landscape, and especially in the distant line of the horizon, man sees something as beautiful as his own nature.\nThe greatest delight which the fields and woods give me is the suggestion of a magical relation between man and the vegetable. I am not alone and unacknowledged They nod to me, and I to them. The waving of the branches in the storm is new to me and old. It takes me by surprise, and yet is not unknown. Its effect is like that of a higher thought or a better emotion coming over me, when I deemed I was thinking justly or doing right.\nYet it is certain that the power to produce this delight does not exist in nature, but in man, or in a harmony of both. It is necessary to use these pleasures with great temperance. For nature does not always wear holiday clothes, but the same scene which yesterday breathed perfume is filled with solemnity today. Nature always wears the colours of the spirit. To a man labouring under a burden, the heat of his own fire has sadness in it. Then, there is a kind of contempt of the landscape felt by him who has just lost by death a dear friend. The sky is less grand as it shuts down over less worth in the population.\n",

"title":"The Other Schindlers",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"It is 1988, and the popular BBC TV programme That’s Life pans over its studio audience. The presenter then says casually, “Is there anyone in our audience tonight who owes their life to Nicholas Winton? If so, could you stand up please?” At her request everyone in the first four rows stands up except for an elderly man and his wife. The man, Nicholas Winton, turns around in complete disbelief, before sitting back down, attempting to hold back the tears.\nThe story begins in 1938. Winton, a young stockbroker from London, went to Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) to see if he could help refugees--mainly Jews--escape the Nazi terror. Most had no real hope of getting out. But was it possible that their children might be able to slip away to safety? Yes, it was possible, provided foster parents could be found for them in England and a £50 bond was posted per child. Winton spent three weeks in Prague, interviewing parents, collecting names, and taking photos of children. He was then able to see off one small group of children. Finding foster parents and dealing with the British bureaucratic indifference seemed an almost impossible problem, however, he returned to London with a list of names in hand.\nBack home, he ran newspaper ads looking for homes for the children, coordinated placement, and got transit permits. He even forged permits when he had to. That summer, eight groups, at least 669 children in all, made it to England with his help. Tragically, a ninth group of 250 children was scheduled to leave, but prevented by the Nazis. Without Winton’s help, nearly all of the 669 children would have become casualties of the Nazi horror. Indeed, such was Nazi brutality that only two of the children in the ninth group survived the war.\nWhen the Second World War began, Winton became an ambulance driver in France and was rescued at Dunkirk. He then joined the British Royal Air Force (RAF). After the war, he quietly engaged himself in charitable activities. His accomplishment in saving those children from near certain death was forgotten, until his wife found a book in his attic with the names of hundreds of children, and asked That’s Life to help her track them down. The episode of the programme which resulted was widely viewed as one of the most moving ever broadcasted, and instantly made Winton a household name. Winton died, honoured and revered, in 2015 at the age of 106.\nOf all the lesser known Schindlers who helped Jews escape the Nazi terror, one of the most obscure is Ho Feng-Shan. Born in Hunan Province, Ho became a diplomat for the Chinese government in 1935, and received a post representing China in Vienna, Austria in 1937. In 1938, Austria was occupied by Nazi Germany, and so the office in Vienna became a Chinese consulate for Germany. Shortly afterwards, an international conference was held in Evian-les-Bains, France with the hope of opening the doors for Jewish refugees to leave Germany. Instead, the conference had the opposite effect —no agreement was reached and most of the countries which attended ref used to accept Jewish refugees. Then on the night of 9 November, the infamous Kristallnacht (Crystal Night) occurred, where ruthless Nazi paramilitaries terrorised the Jews, destroying Jewish businesses and sanctuaries. This triggered chaos as Jews sought to leave Germany. However, all the doors seemed shut.\nThere was one small hope for many Jews — Shanghai. In those days, as an international city, no visas or documents were needed to enter the municipality. The problem was that even though Shanghai did not require a visa, refugees needed to show that they had a valid destination visa to be eligible to leave Germany. In practice, once the refugees left Germany, they could immigrate to any place that would take them; they just wanted to leave Nazi Germany.\nHo had great sympathy for refugees who wanted to leave Germany. Consequently, he decided to give visas to whoever applied. It is not known how many Shanghai visas Ho issued. It is known that he issued nearly 2,000 of them by October 1938, and thousands more until he was transferred back to China in 1940. “It was just natural to feel compassion for those persecuted and help them. It was what had to be done, ”Ho said later.\nHo continued to serve as a diplomat until he retired and went to live in San Francisco, in 1973, where he died in 1997. During his own lifetime, not only did Ho’s deeds go completely unrecognised, but even his own family was unaware of his efforts. However, after his death his daughter discovered the part he played in rescuing so many people, and decided to investigate. This has led to widespread international recognition of his heroism, and in 2000 the Israeli organisation Yad Vashem (The World Holocaust Remembrance Centre) honoured him as “Righteous Among the Nations”.\n",

"text":"Welcome, everyone, to my seminar: “The Pursuit of Happiness”. Today, we’re going to examine the factors that can contribute towards our levels of happiness, and then I’m going to reveal to you all my special five-point plan to become a happier person. Great, so let’s begin!\nFirstly, how would you all define happiness? It’s simple, right? It can be conceived of as just a reflection of the pleasure and excitement that we all experience in life. But we could also say that it stems from our relationships with the people and things around us. And some people might also say that happiness can manifest itself through our faith or beliefs.\nLet’s take a look at what studies on happiness can tell us. We usually become happier as we age, although I must confess this hasn’t happened to me yet! And for every one of us here, family and social relationships are important to our happiness levels. Now, who’s married here? Studies suggest that being married makes us happier than being single, divorced, or widowed. That’s because being married and having kids is the key to happiness, right? Well, as for parenthood, it doesn’t necessarily increase happiness. Some studies actually show a higher level of happiness among people without children. Similarly, many of us presume that attractive people lead a really happy life, but in reality, our looks only have a slight effect on how happy we feel. Actually, concentrating on our inside and maintaining a positive attitude is a much more proven way to boost our happiness, which in turn improves our study and work performance. Now let me ask you all a question: How many of you believe that money can buy happiness? Raise your hands, please Well, interestingly, studies show that money, to an extent, can indeed influence happiness. Generally speaking, at both individual and country level, we’re happier when we’re rich than when we’re poor. In fact, some say our income correlates directly with our happiness, meaning we get happier as our salary increases, which is something I think we can all relate to! However, there is a cut-off point for this effect. Once people start earning over a certain amount of money, they can begin to lose appreciation for the simple things in life that previously made them happy.\nOf course, not all of these factors will be relevant to all of us here. But luckily for us, modern psychology offers a theory that can apply to everyone regardless of their status: the “three elements of happiness”. Let’s take a look.\nThe first element of happiness is known as “the pleasant life”. It means enjoying everyday pleasures that add fun and positivity to our lives, like meeting with our friends or taking a nice walk. The second element is called\"the good life\", which means using our skills to make our lives better. It’s like when we find work that uses our talents or interests, or we pursue a hobby that really satisfies us. The final element is “the meaningful life”--giving something of yourself to others or the world around you. For example, many of us might help our family and friends and maybe even our local community. Now that you know about the three elements, ask yourself, how much do they apply to you and your life? According to this theory, we will be the happiest when we incorporate a balance of all three elements into our lives.\n“So how can I use all this to make me happier?” I hear you ask. Well, I’d like to end with my five-point plan to happiness, which includes the three elements. If you follow these realistic steps, you will almost certainly increase your happiness levels. Everyone ready?\n● First, happiness is a frame of mind, so we must concentrate on the positive. Become accustomed to occasional problems and treat them as just a normal part of life. Learn to look on the bright side and filter out negative thoughts. By doing this, we’ll eventually find our general outlook changes for the better.\n● Secondly, commit to making ourselves and others happy. If we’re not happy with our current job, we should find work in a field that interests us, even if it means retraining. As the saying goes, do what you love! And when we help others, it makes us feel happy, and they’ll be more likely to help us in return.\n● Thirdly, build and cherish relationships. We may feel exhausted each night, but making new friends and keeping in touch with old ones will consequently lead to an increase in our happiness levels.\n● Fourthly, treat ourselves every now and then. However, we need to spend wisely--that means making sure our money is spent on special experiences rather than luxury goods. We should avoid impulse buying, skipping the fancy clothing in favour of a trip to the theatre--preferably with relatives or friends, as it will strengthen our relationship with them, further increasing our happiness in the process.\n● Last but not least, be content with what we’ve got, and live a little. We should not compare ourselves to others whatsoever. Instead, we must be happy in ourselves. And let’s always live for the moment; be spontaneous and do something unprecedented--it will make us feel much more alive.\nSo there you have it: my five tips to a happier life. Now, how about some spontaneous applause mark the end of my presentation? ... Thank you, everyone--stay happy!\n",

"text":"Never had a situation been more desperate. On 26 May 1940, some 400,000 British and French soldiers were trapped at the town of Dunkirk on the north coast of France. Surrounding them were 800,000 German troops, including seven tank divisions. In lightning strikes, this same German army had already defeated the Dutch and Belgian armies and had destroyed most of France’s forces. Now it was getting ready to destroy the soldiers at Dunkirk.\nThe fighting had begun in earnest just 16 days before. Though war had been declared on 3 September 1939, for months if had been a “Phoney War”. France and Germany mobilised their militaries, and Britain sent a force to help defend France, but there had been very little shooting. Meanwhile, both Belgium and the Netherlands had declared neutrality—a neutrality Germany promised to honour. Little did they know what Germany had planned for them.\nOn 10 May, large numbers of German tanks and soldiers invaded the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Resistance quickly fell and their countries surrendered.\nMeanwhile, the French and British fought back, leaving the French army’s right flank lightly protected. German tanks used this to their advantage. They struck the French in the east, destroying or capturing almost all the French forces in their path.\nThen they continued west to the English Channel, trapping much of the remaining French and British forces along the coast. Such was the speed and momentum of the German assault that they seemed undefeatable. Nobody imagined that the attack would be so fierce or so swift. The British army had been guarding the French left flank along the coast, so it was still intact. However, not only were the British and French fighters unable to mount much of a defence, but they had no hope of reinforcements. Worse yet, without these men, Britain had no way to protect itself from German invasion. The fate of a whole nation now lay in the balance.\nThen the miracle began.\nOn 26 May, the British navy began trying to rescue the men trapped at Dunkirk However as the water near Dunkirk was quite shallow, there was no way to get large navy ships close to the shore to pick up the men. The British government quietly put out the word that small boats—-“the Little Ships of Dunkirk”-—were needed to help ferry the men to safety. No sooner had the word gone out than it began to spread like wildfire, and jusf abouf any kind of boaf thaf could move under its own power lifeboats, tugs, fishing boats, and yachts-joined vessels from the British navy to rescue the soldiers. Some of these ships were piloted by the civilians who owned them. They were not soldiers, but rather fishermen, lawyers, and doctors, amongst other professions. They wanted to help their country. most had no weapons but their own brave hearts. All in all, including the Little Ships, there were more than 900 boats that came to help.\nThe scene at Dunkirk was terrifying: wrecked and burning ships everywhere, thousands of British soldiers standing deep in the water, holding their weapons over their heads, hundreds of thousands more in lines on the beaches. Through all the danger moved the little boats coming to the rescue.\nGerman planes came in to attack, raining down a hail of bombs and machine gun bullets, but the little boats continued to come and take aboard soldiers. Tired men staggering across the beach, fell into the little boats, while others died where they stood, among the bombs and bullets. Fortunately, the British Royal Air Force shot down more than a hundred German planes.\nThere was no panic. Seldom was there a mad rush for boats. The men moved slowly forward, neck deep in the water. As those in front were dragged aboard the boats, those in the rear moved up, until it was their turn to be pulled up over the side.\nBoats that had never carried more than a dozen people at a time were now carrying 60 or more. Somehow, they took their loads out to the larger ships waiting offshore and then returned to the beach to load more men. All through the long hours, the work went on. The crews kept pulling the men aboard, took them out to the larger ships, then returned for more. No matter how many times they made the trip, there were still more men waiting to be rescued.\nAnd then at long last, on the morning of 4 June, with the fires growing pale against the daylight and the dive-bombers sweeping in for the kill, the job was done; the beach was empty. Only then did the fleet turn and start home to England.\nIt had been hoped that some 30,000 men might be rescued, but 338,000 were saved, including most of the British army, and over 130,000 French troops. However, this was more than just the rescue of several hundred thousand men. These same British soldiers would go on to defend Britain, help free France from German occupation and then friumph over Nazi Germany. Had if nof been for the miracle af Dunkirk, fhe war might well have been lost.\n",

"title":"Gooseberries",

"text":"(Adapted from Gooseberries by Anton Pavlovich Chekhov)\nIvan, the veterinary surgeon, and Bourkin, the schoolmaster, were enjoying a refreshing walk in the countryside.\n“Last time when we met,” said Bourkin, “you were about to tell me a story.”\n“Yes, I meant to tell you about my brother.”\nJust as Ivan was about to start his story, the heavens opened, catching the two men completely by surprise.\n“We need to take shelter from this harsh weather,” said Bourkin, wiping the rain from his eyes. “Let us go to Aliokhin’s; it’s close by.”\nThe two companions quickly took a shortcut to where Aliokhin lived. In the doorway of the barn stood Aliokhin himself, a man of about forty, tall with long hair, more like a painter than a landowner. He grinned at his acquaintances with great enthusiasm.\n“Welcome, gentlemen!”he said, delighted to see them.“You look wet and weary! Go into the house. I’m just going to quickly bathe. I’ll be with you shortly.”\nThe two men were met by a maid, who had brought them some slippers. She then guided them to some armchairs in a big drawing room, which was enriched with countless bookcases and authentic paintings. Sometime later, Aliokhin appeared, his hair all neatly combed. The three men exchanged greetings and then Bourkin suggested that Ivan should tell his story. Ivan leant back in his chair and commenced his tale, and it seemed as though not only Bourkin and Aliokhin were listening but also the ladies and the officers in the paintings, who were all sternly looking down upon them from their golden frames.\n“My brother, Nicholai Ivanovitch, is two years younger than I. When we were boys, our father died, leaving us with a small estate. But after his death, the estate went to pay his debts. We spent our childhood in the countryside just like peasants’ children, playing in the fields, working in the mill, and so on ... But it was no life of misery. You know, once a man has lived in the country, to the day of his death, he will be drawn to the country.”\n“Anyway, at age 19, my brother began employment as a court clerk. Years passed by and he thought of only one thing: how to return to the country. He used to draw plans of his dream estate that would always have the same things on them: a farmhouse, a cottage, a vegetable garden, and a gooseberry bush. He clung to this dream and began to save every penny he could. He was so poor and hungry that he often looked like a beggar.”\n“30 years on, still with the same notion of buying a farmhouse with a gooseberry bush, he opted to marry an elderly widow--not out of any feeling for her but because she had money. Money, like vodka, can play strange tricks on a man. when his wife passed away, he used her funds to purchase his dream: three hundred acres of land, with a farmhouse, a cottage, and twenty gooseberry bushes.”\n“Last year, I paid a visit to his country paradise. I saw that my brother was no longer a poor, tired court clerk but a landowner and a person of apparent importance. He boasted,‘The people love me. I have only to raise my finger and they will do as I wish.’ And, like a good, noble landowner, he said he often performs acts of charity. On his last birthday, he treated the village peasants to half a bucket of vodka, after which they bowed to him in gratitude and licked his boots in disgusting drunkenness. I remember when he was a court clerk, he was terrified to have an opinion of his own, but now he imagines himself as an important lord with an opinion on everything. It seems as though he had forgotten that our grandfather was a peasant and our father a common soldier.”\n“I remember later that evening when my brother tried the first gooseberries ever grown on his estate, glancing at me in triumph. ‘How delicious!’ he exclaimed. So I tried one, and it was hard and sour. But, as Pushkin said,‘the illusion which exalts us is dearer to us than ten thousand truths.’ I saw a happy man, one whose dream had come true, but it also filled me with a sense of deep despair. No one ever thinks of those who suffer and of all the horror that goes on in life. It appears that a happy man only feels so because the unhappy bear their burden in silence, and without that silence, happiness would be impossible. But life will sooner or later show its claws to those who are selfish. Some misfortune will come for them--illness, poverty, loss--and then no one will see or hear them, just as they now neither see nor hear others. I went away from my brother’s house early in the morning, and ever since then it has been unbearable for me to be in town.”\nIvan then walked over to Aliokhin and shook his hand firmly with both hands.\n“My dear friend! Don’t be satisfied think of all those poor souls in need! While you are still young, strong, and wealthy, do not cease to do good! If our life has a meaning, an aim, it has nothing to do with our personal happiness, but something wiser and greater. My only regret in life is that I have got to this grand old age without even a thought for others. Oh, how I wish it weren’t so.”\nAnd all this Ivan said with a pitiful, imploring smile, as though he were asking Aliokhin a personal favour.\nThen all three were silent. Ivan’s story had satisfied neither Bourkinn or Aliokhin, who both would have rather heard of happier topics. But Aliokhin was pleased enough to have visitors that talked of things that had no direct bearing on his life. He did not think to question whether what Ivan had said was wise or true.\n“Alas, it is bedtime,” said Bourkin, getting up. “Allow me to wish you both goodnight.”\nThe three men then made their way to their separate rooms.\nIvan Ivanovitch uttered a sigh as he undressed in silence and got into bed.\nThe rain lashed against the windowpanes all night long.\n",

"title":"Nature’s Hidden Superpowers",
"lastPosi":0.8235018621627993,
"text":"## Nature’s Properties Often Being Ignored\nWe often take nature for granted. Of course we know that it exists, because it is all around us. It is the water that we splash on our face in the mornings, the freshly cut grass we smell on our way to school, the apple we have for lunch, the golden rays of the setting sun which bathe our world with glory, and the stars which guide our nightly dreams. The breeze that gently touches you cheeks and the clouds that paint images in the sky are constant reminders of nature’s presence. However, it is so easy to become jaded with that which we know too well. And, just as we so often pass by the riot of colours in a garden, not noticing its fantastic beauty, we seldom stop to think that nature is endowed with an array of properties, which, if we had them, would be considered superpowers.\n\n## Stronger Than Steel\nOne popular superhero from a popular film is a teenager who shoots out a silken thread and uses it to fly through the air or catch criminals. While this may seem remarkable, spiders in nature do this all the time. One slender strand of spider silk is less than 1/20 the diameter of a human hair. However, if it were the same size as a steel beam, it would be five times stronger than the steel. It is also tremendously flexible, having the ability to stretch 2 to 4 times its length. This allows spiders to use their silk to spread out like an umbrella to fly through the air, and to weave webs which can catch large prey without breaking. How large a prey? The golden orb weaver spider in Australia is known to catch and eat small birds in its webs. It is also no accident that many webs look like works of art. Some spiders deliberately make them look more beautiful in order to attract insects. Since spider webs often lose their stickiness in a short time, spiders often make a new web, eating the old web to recycle the protein.\n\n## Magic Tree Roots\nOne of the most lovable superheroes in film is a tree-like alien who is able to grow back body parts and reproduce from branches. However, this superhero lacks one super attribute that all real trees have--roots. While typically trees have a root system that is about the size of their branches, up to 90% of some desert trees--such as the mesquite trees--are made up of roots, as they need long roots to find enough water to survive. However, the deepest roots belong to a wild fig tree in Ohrigstad, South Africa, which reach 120 metres underground. But what are roots’ superpowers? For one thing, they are strong enough to break apart rocks and concrete. Since they are constantly in search of water, if they find a crack in a stone, they will force their way into it and over time break it apart. For another, some tree roots appear to have telepathic powers and can use this to communicate with other trees about the weather and growing conditions. Through their roots, some trees even provide nutrients to other trees in their area which are struggling to survive.\n\n## The Powerful Oceans\nOne of the most powerful superheroes in film is a woman who can call forth instant hurricanes and even lightning bolts to overcome the bad guys. Her real-life prototype is the ocean. Much of the solar radiation striking Earth--more than 100 times the energy used by humans--is absorbed by oceans and circulated by currents around the globe, warming areas farther away from the solar radiation. Warmth from the oceans heats the air, causing it to rise and form wind. Warm ocean water also evaporates and turns into the moisture that forms clouds and rain; 85% to 90% of the rain on earth comes from ocean water. Thus, the vast majority of the earth’s storms, even those far away from the sea, are activated by the oceans’ great power. The most powerful storms by far are hurricanes, which are created on the ocean and then move over land. A typical hurricane releases the same energy as 10,000 nuclear bombs. The power of ocean is really beyond our imagination!\n\n## Knowing Our Proper Place\nOf course though nature has superpowers, it is not a superhero--it is not a person whom we can talk to and bargain with. Rather, it is a powerful force that holds us at its mercy. As much as we try to make use of nature and bend it to our will, we are the ones who must always adapt. In the same way that we must live our lives by the rhythms of the sun though the sun does not notice our existence, it is we who must order our lives by nature, and not the other way around. This should create in us both humility and awe. Nature is more powerful, mysterious, and beautiful than anything we ourselves could ever make with our own hands. Just as we cannot control the wind, we cannot create anything as beautiful as a simple rose, and there is so much about nature that is still beyond our comprehension. Since our own powers and abilities are so limited compared to the richness of nature, we would do well to appreciate it more, to stop and consider its greatness, to stand in a we of its complexity and magnificence.\n",

"title":"Affection",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"(Adapted from The Conquest of Happiness by Bertrand Russell)\nI wish now to speak of the affection that a person gives. This also is of two different kinds, one of which is perhaps the most important expression of a zest for life, while the other is an expression of fear. The former seems tome wholly admirable, while the latter is at best a consolation. If you are sailing in a ship on a fine day along a beautiful coast, you admire the coast and feel pleasure in it. This pleasure is one derived entirely from looking outward and has nothing to do with any desperate need of your own. If, on the other hand, your ship is wrecked and you swim towards the coast, you acquire for it a new kind of love: It represents security against the waves, and its beauty or ugliness becomes an unimportant matter. The better sort of affection corresponds to the feeling of the man whose ship is secure, while the less excellent sort corresponds to that of the shipwrecked swimmer. The first kind of affection is only possible in so far as a man feels safe. The latter kind, on the contrary, is caused by the feeling of insecurity. The feeling caused by insecurity is very subjective and self-centred, since the loved person is valued for services rendered, not for intrinsic qualities. I do not, however, wish to suggest that this kind of affection has no legitimate part to play in life. In fact, almost all real affection contains something of both kinds in combination. Affection does really cure the sense ot insecurity; it sets a person free to feel again that interest in the world that is obscured in moments of danger and fear. But despite all this, it is still no match for affection felt through security, because it depends upon fear, and it is more self-centred. In the best kind of affection, a person hopes for a new happiness rather than for escape from an old unhappiness.\nThe best type of affection is mutually life-giving. Each person receives affection with joy and gives it without effort, and each finds the whole world more interesting in consequence of the existence of this mutual happiness. However, there is another kind of affection that is commonly seen in life, in which one person sucks the vitality of the other. One receives what the other gives, but gives almost nothing in return. Some very vital people belong to this bloodsucking type. They extract the vitality from one victim after another, but while they prosper and grow interesting, the victims grow pale and dim and dull. Such people use others as a means to their own ends and never consider them as ends in themselves. Fundamentally, they are not interested in those whom for the moment they think they love; they are interested only in the stimulus they get from the relationship. Evidently, this springs from some defect in their nature, but it is one not altogether easy either to diagnose or to cure. It is a characteristic frequently associated with great ambition and is rooted deeply. It is, in essence, a very one-sided view of human happiness. Affection in the sense of a genuine interest of two persons in each other, not solely as a means to each other’s good, but rather as a common good is one of the foremost elements of real happiness. The man whose ego is so enclosed within steel walls that he only thinks of himself misses the best that life has to offer however successful he may be in his career. Ambition which excludesaffection from others is generally the result of some kind of anger or hatred against the human race, produced by unhappiness in youth, by injustices in later life, or by any of the cause which lead to persecution mania. A too powerful ego is a prison from which a man must escape if he is to enjoy the world to the full. A capacity for genuine affection is one of the marks of the man who has escaped from this prison of self. To receive affection is by no means enough. Affection which is received should liberate the affection which is to be given, and only where both exist in equal measure does affection achieve its best possibilities.\n\n",

"title":"The Blue Bird",

"text":"The Parenting Monthly viewing recommendation this month comes in the form of a marvellous new play that is showing at the Paradise Theatre. It is an adaptation of a play from over a century ago, The Blue Bird, by Maurice Maeterlinck. We strongly recommend it for its imaginative storyline and underlying strong moral values. Here is a description of its main messages and features.\nThe story depicts a young brother and sister who live in a humble cottage with their hard-working parents. One night, the children enter a strange dream world, where they are visited by a fairy, who asks them to find the Blue Bird of Happiness. The fairy then turns their pets and various household objects into real people so they can escort the children on an adventure full of wonder, temptation, and magic.\nThe play presents itself as a typical children’s storybook adventure, with the added bonus that it teaches kids about the true meaning of happiness. For example, in the Land of Memory, the children encounter their beloved grandparents, who have already passed away, signalling heavily to the audience that we should all treasure the happy times spent with relatives.\nThe play also does a great job of showing how the kids realise they have.\nan important task to complete and must resist all temptation. In the Palace of Happiness scene, many of life’s luxuries are personified for the children to see. Characters such as “The Luxury of Being Rich” and “The Luxury of Eating When You’re Not Hungry” all seem very attractive at first. However, upon using a magic hat, the children gradually begin to see their inherent flaws. Throughout their journey, the children are successful in finding several Blue Birds, but each time there is a complication. Naturally, the children become discouraged, prompting their mother to appear in the dream to comfort them. Eventually, the children return home and fall asleep. When they wake up, they find themselves in the real world again, showing a refound appreciation for their home, pets, and parents, stressing the old proverb of being happy with what you’ve got.\nThe play’s cast performed well throughout the show. The choice of actors, some of whom are quite well known in the theatre world, was very fulfilling. From start to finish, the actors’ teamwork and showmanship carried the audience on a convincing journey across the story’s magical land. The children’s performances were especially potent, their passion and comradeship reminding us how rewarding watching live performances can really be.\nThe play’s design elements were very well thought out and, just like the casting, showed no signs of idleness. It was a little disheartening to hear a small complication with the audio system during the first scene, but it was soon fixed and the play continued nonetheless. The stage design and props, although quite basic at times, were enough to set the scene. In addition, the characters’ costumes were quite creative and convincing, with clever use of makeup to bring out their features.\nThe overall reaction to the performance seemed very positive. For a century-old play, it was still very relevant to modern times. And, most importantly, it taught the kids how to appreciate the happiness that is right there under their little noses, undoubtedly making them return home that little bit happier.\n",

"lastPosi":0.6636926070268142,
"text":"One afternoon, they were sitting on the seat that looks down into Govetts Leap--the great valley that the highest rocks of the mountains guard. The five girls were gazing out into the great stretches of mountains rolling back against the sky.\n“Oh, to see this place with the sun behind it!”cried Mabel, suddenly. “If we could only see the sun rise there beyond those great, dark rocks, and make all the sky turn red. By the time we get down here in the daytime it’s all uninteresting to look at.”\nAfter tea that night they told their mother that they wanted to see the sunrise at the Leap.\n“You will all be very careful?”\n“Of course we will.”\nAt that the mother gave her permission.\nSo that same night the billy was packed with tea, sugar, and a little bottle of milk. Mabel cut sandwiches and made them into a parcel.\nAt three the alarm went off, and in approximately a quarter of an hour everyone was dressed ready to go out.\nAs they opened the back door and stepped out into the yard, they all had little thrills of fear running up and down their nerves. They were soon down on the long red road that led to Govetts Leap.\nUp in the sky there were many stars, and from them came all the light that there was, except the lantern’s beams. Then some long, thin rays of light, just where the mountains touched the sky.\nOn either side of the road the bush was black and still. But from it there came stealing sweet, pure tree-scents and leaf odours--the scent of cherry-wood and of sharp grey gum trees.\nThen a pale, weak light crept out into the darkness, the trees in the bush around were not quite so black, and the road in front began to show faintly white. Turn after turn of the long red road went by. All the time the light was strengthening, and the lantern’s beam was paling.\nOne more turn, and the white fence at the head of the Leap came into view. They hurried on their cheeks blooming with the roses of health and early morning, and dropped their basket and the billy on the steps of the adjacent look-out shed.\nThen they seated themselves on the steps and watched. They were just in time.\nFirst, the sky beyond the Leap turned pale, pale pink. Then a sparkling zig-zag line of gold wrote itself right across the pink. It was like a flash of golden lightning come to stay.\nA great red ship came sailing into the pink and gold. After it, there floated a medieval castle. Seas and rivers and mountains rose from some mysterious place, and floated across the sky. The footsteps of the five rang clearly and evenly on the air.\nThen a small, bright, yellow thing, rising from behind a far-off peak. Slowly, and yet quickly, it went up into the sky.\nAll in a moment a flood of light burst out over the eastern mountains, the yellow thing was round and brilliant, the sky was one sea of red. The eyes that watched were blinded, and looked down a minute; and the sun had risen.\nThe Leap was no longer the dull, grave Leap of the noon and afternoon. The light was pouring down through it, and its mists were glowing with old gold and rose and tender orange and kingly purple.\nOn the mountain sides the leaves of the trees were gleaming like diamonds. Over the rocks rolled the water in a fall of jewels. The rocks themselves stood out against a blazing red background. A change, more wonderful even than the sunset’s, had over swept the world.\nThe five little girls sat on the steps, and watched with eager eyes. They sighed, and breathed hard, and sighed again, and never took their eyes from the sky for a moment. For the wonder was all new to them--the fair wonder of a mountain dawn.\nThe sun rose higher and higher over the top of the Leap, and the colour in the sky changed to what Brenda called “only sunlight”.\nThen their voices all broke out at once.\n“Oh, how lovely!”\n“Wasn’t it red!”\n“Wasn’t the sun gold!”\n“Wasn’t the sky beautiful!”\n“I wouldn’t have missed it for anything in the world,” declared Lennie.\n“Neither would I,” said Mabel just as solemnly, and of course the little sisters echoed her words.\nThe fire was made, the billy boiled, and egg sandwiches were eaten on the wooden steps along with some tea, the mountains rolling out before them. It was the sweetest breakfast they had ever known. And, above all, it was five o’clock in the morning, and they were miles away from home, in the heart of the Blue Mountains.\n",

"title":"Taking Luding Bridge",
"lastPosi":0,
"text":"(Adapted from Red Star Over China by Edgar Snow)\nSome 400 li to the west of An Shun Chang, there was Luding Bridge, the last possible crossing of the Dadu River east of Tibet. Toward this the barefoot Red Army men now set out. If they captured Luding Bridge the whole army could enter central Sichuan. If they failed they would have to fight their way westward toward Li Jiang -- a detour of more than a thousand li. Day and night the Red Army moved, pausing only for brief ten-minute rests and meals. “Victory was life,” said Peng Dehuai, “defeat was certain death.” On the second day, White Army reinforcements appeared, hurrying to Luding Bridge. For a whole day these troops raced each other along the stream, but gradually the leading Red soldiers pulled away from the enemy’s tired soldiers.\nLuding Bridge was built centuries ago. Thirteen heavy iron chains, with a span of some 100 yards or more, were stretched across the river, their ends imbedded on each side under great piles of cemented rock, beneath the stone bridgeheads. Thick boards lashed over the chains made the road of the bridge, but upon their arrival the Reds found that half of this wooden flooring had been removed, and before them only the bare iron chains swung to a point midway in the stream. At the northern bridgehead an enemy machine gun nest faced them, and behind it were positions held by a regiment of White troops. The bridge should, of course, have been destroyed, but the Sichuanese were sentimental about their few bridges; it was not easy to rebuild them, and they were costly. And who would have thought the Red Army would insanely try to cross on the chains alone? But that was what they did.\nNo time was to be lost. The bridge must be captured before enemy reinforcements arrived. Once more volunteers were called for. One by one Red soldiers ventured forward to risk their lives, and, of those who offered themselves, thirty were chosen. Hand grenades and Mausers were strapped to their backs, and soon they were swinging out above the boiling river, moving hand over hand, clinging to the swaying iron chains.\nThe Red Army’s machine guns sprayed the bridgehead with bullets. The enemy replied with machine-gunning of their own, and snipers shot at the Reds high above the water, working slowly toward them. The first warrior was hit, and splashed into the current below; a second fell, and then a third. But as others drew nearer the centre, the bridge flooring somewhat protected them, and most of the enemy bullets glanced off, or ended in the cliffs on the opposite bank.\nProbably never before had the Sichuanese seen fighters like these--men for whom soldiering was not just a rice bowl and youths ready to sacrifice themselves to win. Were they human beings or madmen? Was their own morale affected? Did they perhaps not shoot to kill? Did some of them secretly hope that these men would succeed in their attempt? At last one Red crawled up over the bridge flooring, and tossed a grenade with perfect aim into the enemy position. Nationalist officers ordered the rest of the planking torn up. It was already too late. More Reds were crawling into sight. Wax was thrown on the planking, and it began to burn. By then about twenty Reds were moving forward on their hands and knees, tossing grenade after grenade into the enemy machine gun nest.\nSuddenly, on the southern shore, their comrades began to shout with joy. “Long live the Red Army! Long live the Revolution! Long live the heroes of the Dadu River!” For the enemy was withdrawing. Running full speed over the remaining planks of the bridge, through the flames licking toward them, the Red Army soldiers hopped into the enemy’s now vacant position and turned the abandoned machine gun against the shore.\nMore Reds now came over the chains, and arrived to help put out the fire and replace the boards. And soon afterwards the Red division that had crossed at An Shun Chang came into sight, opening a flank attack on the remaining enemy positions, so that in a little while the White troops were completely in flight--either in flight, that is, or with the Reds, for about a hundred Sichuan soldiers here threw down their rifles and turned to join the Reds. In an hour or two the whole army was happily singing its way across the Dadu River into Sichuan. Far overhead roared the planes of Jiang Jieshi, and the Reds yelled out in challenge to them.\nFor their bravery the heroes of An Shun Chang and Luding Bridge were awarded the Gold Star, highest decoration in the Red Army of China.\n",
